				<p>The Microsoft antitrust settlement, if approved, would be a potential death blow to open source and free software interoperability with Microsoft products. See <a HREF="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2001-11-06-005-20-OP-MS">this analysis</a> by Jeremy Allison &#038; Andrew Tridgell of the <a HREF="http://us1.samba.org/samba/samba.html">Samba project</a>.
</p>
<p>I asked Eben Moglen, general counsel of the <a HREF="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>, to explain why there&#8217;s such worry in the free software community. He noted that that the settlement document was changing somewhat under pressure from state attorneys general, but replied this way based on what the foundation had seen:
</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The settlement in paragraphs III.D and E says that Microsoft mustdocument its APIs within reasonable time, for ISVs, &#8220;for the solepurpose of interoperating with a Windows Operating System Product.&#8221;&#8221;Sole&#8221; is the critical word.  Not, that is, to allow a competingNon-Microsoft &#8220;operating system product&#8221; to interoperate with Windows*applications*.  This is designed to make it possible for Microsoft todeny information to developers of GNU/Linux software like WINE thatallows Windows apps to run on non-Microsoft OSs.  Even if theinformation could be used for both purposes, the inclusion of the word&#8221;sole&#8221; creates an argument Microsoft can make to the Court that theuse of the information to make Windows app binaries run unmodified onGNU/Linux/X systems through WINE or equivalent is a misuse of itsproprietary information that the settlement requires it to release&#8221;solely&#8221; for other purposes.
<p></i>
<p><i>III. I(5) says that &#8220;an ISV, IHV, IAP, ICP, or OEM may be required to<br />grant to Microsoft on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms a license<br />to any intellectual property rights it may have relating to the<br />exercise of their options or alternatives provided by this Final<br />Judgment; the scope of such license shall be no broader than is<br />necessary to insure that Microsoft can provide such options or<br />alternatives.&#8221;  Microsoft will use this to argue that code under the<br />GPL must be licensed to it on non-GPL terms, so they can use the code<br />in their own programs without having to GPL their programs.
<p></i></p>
<p><i>The draft settlement also uses RAND to describe the terms on which<br />Microsoft must provide the information about APIs required for release<br />under the agreement.  But RAND terms, if those involve &#8220;reasonable&#8221;<br />payments to Microsoft for API information, can exclude a large<br />proportion of the world&#8217;s free software developers.
<p></i></p>
<p><i>We will argue to the Justice Department and the Court that the<br />settlement should require Microsoft to release the API and other<br />technical documentation freely and without limitation, to allow anyone<br />to write programs that interoperate with Windows, and to allow Windows<br />apps to execute under non-Windows OSs.

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Mercury News: <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/docs/hottopics/msantitrust/msset110601.htm">Half the states agree to revised settlement with Microsoft</a>. <i>&#8220;Every judge who has heard the case agrees that Microsoft engaged in illegal business practices,&#8221; California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said. &#8220;While the settlement proposals are a step forward, they fail to provide adequate remedies for Microsoft&#8217;s illegal use of its monopoly power to crush innovative technology.&#8221;</i></p>
<blockquote><p>So it&#8217;s down to a few states that have enough money to fight and refused to be bullied. They are American consumers&#8217; last hope for an outcome that doesn&#8217;t leave Microsoft on a clear path toward controlling the choke points of tomorrow&#8217;s commerce and communications.
<p>No one should be surprised that half of the state attorneys general have given up. A few undoubtedly believe the Justice Department&#8217;s sellout achieved something. Others were just been along for the ride and are feeling Microsoft&#8217;s &#8212; and the federal government&#8217;s &#8212; enormous lobbying pressure. Watch the campaign contributions flow to see what may have happened with at least some of the politicians who were handling this lawsuit.
</p>
<p>If U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who&#8217;s now hearing the case, has any courage, the Tunney Act hearing should be extremely revealing. There are so many questions raised by the malodorous deal cut by the Justice Department that it&#8217;s hard to know where to begin.
</p>
<p>The best place to start is with the odious settlement itself. The document reads as though it had been written by Microsoft lawyers. Perhaps it was.
</p>
<p>Here are three quick questions. The answers tell you what a fraud this settlement is.
</p>
<p>
<li>Why did the monopolist get to keep the money it made from violating the law? Do we give bank robbers the same courtesy?
<li>Why does this settlement permit Microsoft to refuse to supply information about its programming interfaces to open-source and free software writers?
<li>Microsoft, in its sole authority, gets to decide what goes into Windows. Since that eviscerates every other provision in the agreement, why bother with this charade at all?
</p>
<p>It would also be useful to put a whole bunch of people under oath for some questions about the politics of this case. For instance:
</p>
<p>
<li>Why did none of the non-political professional staff that worked on this case support the settlement? Have they been ordered to keep their mouths shut? If so, why?
<li>What was the substance of the summer conversation between Vice President Dick Cheney and Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer?
<li>Attorney General John Ashcroft&#8217;s deputy chief of staff &#8212; a Microsoft shareholder and former official of the Republican Party, which got massive Microsoft campaign &#8220;contributions&#8221; &#8212; reportedly told Microsoft opponents to back off even after he&#8217;d supposedly recused himself from the case. He&#8217;s denied the report, but let him do so under penalty of perjury.
</p>
<p>And this:
</p>
<p>
<li>What side deals have Microsoft and the Justice Department struck on matters such as encryption and surveillance?
</p>
<p>The last of these questions may have the longest-term significance, apart from Microsoft&#8217;s growing ability to rule whatever part of commerce it chooses. Is it possible that Microsoft and the government have made some deals that will be couched under &#8220;anti-terrorism&#8221; rhetoric when they emerge into the public light?
</p>
<p>I hope not. I would prefer to think that Microsoft was saved by an administration that opposes antitrust enforcement on ideological grounds, as this one surely does.
</p>
<p>California deserves special credit for its stance. Bill Lockyer, the state attorney general, has emerged as the most important public official in America when it comes to holding back the Microsoft tide.
</p>
<p>Microsoft now loathes him more than any other public official, and Microsoft has bottomless pockets and utter ruthlessness. <a href="http://caag.state.ca.us/index.htm">Contact Lockyer&#8217;s office</a> and express your support. He needs to hear from people who understand what&#8217;s at stake.
<p></p></blockquote>
<p><i>Note: An earlier version of today&#8217;s journal incorrectly referred to a meeting between Ballmer and another administration official.</i></p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Frank McPherson, who writes an interesting weblog, says he&#8217;s stopped reading me due to <a href="http://fmcpherson.weblogger.com/2001/11/03">boredom</a> with my &#8220;constant Microsoft bashing.&#8221; Sorry hear that, but his reaction is exactly what Microsoft wants.
</p>
<p>Frank may be bored, but the facts are still the facts. Namely, Microsoft is a bigger and more dangerous threat to a free marketplace than it&#8217;s ever been.
</p>
<p>Frank doesn&#8217;t see how consumers have been harmed, so he thinks the antitrust case is a dud. He&#8217;s missing the point on both counts. First, antitrust laws are designed to protect <i>competition</i>, which ultimately protects consumers. That&#8217;s a crucial distinction, and it&#8217;s often misunderstood.
</p>
<p>Protecting competition means protecting innovators from predatory behavior by monopolists. It&#8217;s impossible to say how much innovation has been lost in the software industry due to this particular monopolist, but by any standard Microsoft has held back progress in at least several key areas. The Web browser is only one. Venture capitalists routinely dismiss proposals from software startups that even might reach the Microsoft radar screen.
</p>
<p>One of Microsoft&#8217;s most effective tactics is to outlast its opponents. The typically American short attention span helps the company keep critics at bay. People really would rather move on.
</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t just move on, because Microsoft not only doesn&#8217;t change its behavior but consistently ups the ante. I hope Frank doesn&#8217;t find himself on the receiving end of one of Microsoft&#8217;s missiles one of these days. His boredom is a monopolist&#8217;s best weapon right now.
</p>
<p>Frank also thinks it&#8217;s lame for anyone to connect the antitrust settlement with Sept. 11. Get real. <i>Every</i> major decision in the federal government today has a connection. Even the judge in the case referred to the attacks in saying she wanted a prompt settlement.
</p>
<p>He also thinks that Microsoft issues are &#8220;petty compared to the human suffering caused by the events on September 11.&#8221; Who says otherwise?
</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean we should retreat into our caves, or think about nothing but terrorism and its consequences. The world is still turning. People are still living and working and struggling. And Microsoft isn&#8217;t quitting its pursuit of an increasingly scary agenda to control the choke points of commerce and communications.

<p>I&#8217;m weary of Microsoft and its unsavory practices. But I won&#8217;t stop talking about them until those practices change.

				<p>&#8220;Sellout&#8221; isn&#8217;t too strong a word to describe the U.S. Justice Department&#8217;s <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/docs/hottopics/msantitrust/023027.htm">settlement</a> (press release) with Microsoft. Neither is &#8220;dangerous.&#8221; (Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-201-7758181-0.html">full text</a>.)
</p>
<p>This deal, assuming it takes hold, is not even a wrist slap. It&#8217;s a love letter to the most arrogant and unrepentant monopolist since Standard Oil. It&#8217;s an invitation to keep on plundering and whacking competition in the most important marketplace of our times, the information marketplace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The goals of the government were to obtain relief that stops Microsoft from engaging in unlawful conduct, prevent any recurrence of that conduct in the future, and restore competition in the software market-we have achieved those goals,&#8221; Charles James, the head of the department&#8217;s antitrust division, said in a statement released Friday in Washington.
</p>
<p>Those may have been the goals, once upon a time. But James and his quisling colleagues didn&#8217;t come close. What&#8217;s more, they surely know it.
</p>
<p>Bill Gates&#8217; own statement would be amusing if the situation were less disturbing. The deal, he was quoted as saying, &#8220;imposes some very tough rules and restrictions on our business.&#8221; That unctuous garbage is about what you&#8217;d expect from a man who made it clear that his company would never agree willingly to any serious curbs on its behavior. Microsoft still hasn&#8217;t made any such agreement.
</p>
<p>The settlement not only doesn&#8217;t doesn&#8217;t even force the company to stop doing what eight federal judges found illegal, but it provides no penalty for the illegal acts. Locking in the ill-gained profits of crime &#8212; bank robbers wish they could get such dispensation.
</p>
<p>Who gets to monitor this malodorous deal? Why, the same Justice Department that made it, with no input from the states or anyone else apart from a &#8220;Technical Committee&#8221; that keeps an eye on the company&#8217;s behavior. The work and findings of this committee, which will be appointed by the department and its new pal, Microsoft, will be a state secret.
</p>
<p>In the alleged concessions on future behavior, Microsoft gives  up almost nothing that matters anymore. A couple of the measures, such as giving computer makers modestly more freedom, might have made a difference five years ago. They are close to meaningless today, given the pervasiveness of the monopoly.
</p>
<p>So where do we go from here? Just where Microsoft wants us to go, apparently.
</p>
<p>The states knew they were going to be sandbagged on this case. The Bush administration hasn&#8217;t hidden its intentions to let the lawbreakers go free. The fix was in, and everyone knew it.
</p>
<p>Will the states fold, too? Many will, no doubt. Mere state governments don&#8217;t have the money to fight a monopolist that generates more than $1 billion in extra cash every month, just a portion of the profits that even in an economic downturn keep rolling into the coffers.
</p>
<p>Some states will probably keep fighting. Despite having won a case that showed Microsoft to be a sneering, brutal lawbreaker &#8212; with no intention of reforming &#8212; they&#8217;re now total underdogs.
</p>
<p>The next step is a Tunney Act hearing, where the judge is supposed to determine if the settlement is in the public interest. The last judge who held a Tunney Act hearing on a Microsoft antitrust settlement was so incensed by what he saw that he, like the judge in the trial, shot off his mouth and got tossed off the case.
</p>
<p>The European Union is also a slender reed of hope. But the EU will be under enormous pressure from the U.S. to go along.
</p>
<p>With a nation and world preoccupied by terrorism and war, the Bush administration has awarded the hen house to the meanest fox in the woods. The message to corporate America is simple. Do whatever the hell you want, because antitrust law is effectively dead. Ideology and money have triumphed over common sense and competition.
</p>
<p>What a sham. What a shame.

				<p>It&#8217;s good to be back here. I&#8217;m teaching for the third year in a row at the <a HREF="http://www.hku.hk">University of Hong Kong</a>. The first class was yesterday, and I have an excellent group of students. They&#8217;re studying for Master&#8217;s degrees. We set up weblogs on the first day, and will be working on them in the weeks ahead.
</p>
<p>The frenetic pace in this city is remarkable. Someone memorably called it &#8220;Manhattan on speed,&#8221; an accurate description. To say that people work hard here is the grossest kind of understatement.
</p>
<p>The hotel where I&#8217;m staying charges HK$20 (about US$2.50) to connect my PC to the Internet. I can take cab to the university for less money. Ridiculous, and greedy on the part of the hotel.
</p>
<p>Similarly crazy is the charge for laundry. An old Hong Kong hand introduced me to a small laundry around the corner, where they charge by the pound. Another lost opportunity for the hotel, but another opportunity for me to support the hard-working local merchant.

				<p>Mercury News: <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/docs/news/svfront/decss110201.htm">Movie industry dealt DVD-cracking blow</a>. <i>Ruling that free speech deserves more protection than trade secrets in cyberspace, a state appeals court dealt a blow Thursday to the DVD industry in its legal fight to prevent Web sites from posting software to unscramble the encryption on DVDs.</i>
</p>
<blockquote><p>This <a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/Video/DVDCCA_case/20011101_bunner_appellate_decision.html">decision</a> is one of the most important victories for free speech in years. The appeals said, qiute simply, that code is speech.
<p>The idea that merely linking to another Web site could somehow violate the law has always been offensive. That hasn&#8217;t stopped the entertainment industry, and at least one judge, from spitting on the First Amendment by ordering people to stop linking.
</p>
<p>The appeals court&#8217;s ruling is nothing more than common sense. In these times, common sense is depressingly rare.<br />
