				<p><img src="http://static2.userland.com/pictures/ejournal/hknight.jpg" height="240" width="320" border="0" alt="HongKongNight: View from Victoria Peak."><br />The view from Victoria Peak can be spectacular, especially when the pollution level is lower than normal. This was one such evening.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Yahoo and the French Internet Censors</font></p>
<p>The Western world might consider shedding some of its pretenses of political superiority when it behaves just like the worst players on the international stage. Case in point: a French judge&#8217;s ruling that <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/front/docs/yahoo112100.htm">Yahoo should censor itself</a> (Mercury News) when delivering content to France.</p>
<p>You can sympathize, to a point, with the French. The Nazi memorabilia on Yahoo&#8217;s site may well be offensive to lots of people. </p>
<p>I personally find it disgusting, though I also think it&#8217;s valuable to preserve a historical record. The difference between a neo-Nazi&#8217;s collection and historical society&#8217;s collection may be clear to me and you, but it&#8217;s not possible to be clear in a Web auction &#8212; and it&#8217;s none of Yahoo&#8217;s business why customers behave as they do.</p>
<p>In China, the powers-that-be don&#8217;t want their citizens to look at the New York Times on the Web or any number of other sites deemed politically untoward. The Chinese government is sharply limiting the number of Internet service providers and forcing them to block the supposedly offending sites.</p>
<p>France doesn&#8217;t have so many limits on ISPs, but it has decided Yahoo can determine the physical location of a Web surfer and then deny access to certain material just for people in certain places. This is technically impossible. </p>
<p>Yes, some companies are working on ways to make it more possible, but even if they succeed there will always be relay sites that pass along users&#8217; requests. As <a href="http://www.toad.com/gnu/">John Gilmore</a> has said so memorably, &#8220;The Net treats censorship as damage and routes around it.&#8221;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s Net-censorship policies remain a barrier to progress in the most populous place on Earth. It&#8217;s a shame to see France moving in the wrong direction.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Time Warner and EarthLink Make a Deal</font></p>
<p>San Jose Mercury News: <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/top/docs/earth112100.htm">Final hurdles for AOL-Time Warner</a>. <i>EarthLink access deal is a huge leap for merger plans.</i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>I hope not.</p>
<p>One deal permitting a competitive Internet access provider to use Time Warner&#8217;s cable lines is not the same thing as open access. It&#8217;s a sop to the antitrust authorities who, I fear, may be looking for a reason to let American Online&#8217;s buyout of Time Warner go through.</p>
<p>Earthlink is an excellent ISP. So is AOL. That&#8217;s not the point. </p>
<p>The point is that these kinds of deals will create an oligopoly of ISPs, a cozy few &#8220;competitors&#8221; that ultimately will raise prices as they shut other ISPs out of the market. It&#8217;s not a coincidence that America&#8217;s Internet surge has coincided with the rampantly free market in Internet service, from mom-and-pop operations all the way up to AOL&#8217;s gargantuan and frequently anticompetitive system.</p>
<p>The cable companies should be required to do what the phone companies must do according to law: Offer access to anyone who wants it and can put in the right equipment to link up. This is not, contrary to the cable company&#8217;s protests, anything close to rocket science. </p>
<p>&#8220;Our partnership with EarthLink demonstrates our commitment to offer Time Warner Cable customers multiple choices in broadband ISPs,&#8221; Glenn A. Britt, president of Time Warner Cable, told the Mercury News&#8217; Heather Fleming Phillips.</p>
<p>Maybe the commitment is real. But one deal sure doesn&#8217;t prove it.</p>

				<p>Washington Post: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A14385-2000Nov13.html">Bush Cousin Made Florida Vote Call For Fox News</a>. <i>Which is why media circles were buzzing yesterday with the question of why Fox had installed a Bush relative in such a sensitive post.</i></p>
<p>Eric Mink (NY York Daily News): <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/2000-11-15/New_York_Now/Television/a-88531.asp">&#8216;Fair&#8217;? R-i-i-ght</a>. <i>Fox News Channel&#8217;s bias is clear</i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>It was bad enough that the big TV networks &#8220;called&#8221; Florida for Al Gore on Election Night, then withdrew that announcement, then gave the state to George W. Bush and then withdrew that prediction. That sequence will go down in journalism infamy for its sheer arrogance.</p>
<p>The Fox News people were first to award Florida to Bush, and used the announcement to award him &#8212; also grossly prematurely &#8212; the presidency. The other networks, true to their lemming-like nature, rushed to follow that lead. And Gore has been fighting the possibly false perception that he lost ever since.</p>
<p>Now we learn that Bush&#8217;s first cousin, a man who was having regular conversations that night with the Republican candidate and Bush&#8217;s brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, was partly or even largely responsible for the Fox News decision to declare George Bush the winner.</p>
<p>Does this stink, or what? </p>
<p>Now, Fox News is free to tilt to the political right, or even shill for the GOP and its candidates if it wants to. It should own up to its biases up front, however.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it develops that Barbara Walters is <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/489609.asp">shilling for Campbell Soup</a> (Wall Street Journal) on an ABC TV program. ABC News doesn&#8217;t see the problem.  No surprise there, either, sadly.</p></blockquote>

				<p><img src="http://static2.userland.com/pictures/ejournal/bankchina.jpg" height="320" width="240" border="0" alt="BankOfChina: Bank of China building, Hong Kong"><br />This masterwork of architecture, designed by I.M. Pei, is the Bank of China Tower. It&#8217;s not just one of the two or three the most striking buildings in Hong Kong. It&#8217;s one of the world&#8217;s great structures.</p>
<p>The tower symbolizes many things. One inspiration, according to the bank&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bankofchina.com/en/aboutus/1d.htm">Web site</a>, is the &#8220;elegant poise of bamboo,&#8221; where each section of the trunk propels new sections higher.</p>
<p>Bamboo is one of the fastest growing plants in the world. That, too, seems symbolic. Hong Kong&#8217;s economy is a masterpiece of booms, where markets climb skyward like bamboo shoots that grow more rapidly than any other plant.</p>
<p>But Hong Kong&#8217;s markets don&#8217;t defy gravity for long. They tend to collapse, with devastating consequences for the people who got into the game late. It&#8217;s been that way for decades in the real estate market. More recently, mania arrived here in the guise of the technology revolution.</p>
<p>Nowhere have this entrepreneurial city&#8217;s manic-depressive financial tendencies been evident than in the Internet economy. It took off late last year and early in 2000. When the U.S. Internet market caught a serious flu last spring, Hong Kong&#8217;s dot-com wonders, many of which were the so-called &#8220;GEMs&#8221; of the local equities market, caught the proverbial pneumonia. </p>
<p>GEM is short for the <a href="http://www.hkgem.com/root/e_default.asp">Growth Enterprise Market,</a>, which the <a href="http://www.sehk.com.hk/">Stock Exchange of Hong Kong</a> launched a year ago. With a strong focus on technology stocks, it was another of the many NASDAQ competitors that have sprung up around the world in recent years.</p>
<p>In the heady days of the dot-com bubble it all seemed like a fine idea. Maybe it will be in the end. </p>
<p>But the subtitle on GEM&#8217;s home page &#8212; &#8220;A &#8216;Buyers Beware&#8217; Market for Informed Investors&#8221; &#8212; seems to have been ignored by a lot of the tech-crazed folks who raced into the market.</p>
<p>Chinese portal sites were particularly huge. Now they&#8217;re &#8220;a graveyard,&#8221; says Dan Schwartz, publisher of the Asian Venture Capital Journal, which is based here and in Silicon Valley. &#8220;It was nuts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The GEM stock index is almost two-thirds off its high &#8212; the second-worst showing among tech-oriented exchanges in Asia, according to a recent survey by Reuters. The volatility is no surprise, given the specious business models of some of the companies that managed to pull off initial public offerings before the dot-com bubble deflated.</p>
<p>As of last week, 36 of GEM&#8217;s 49 listed companies were selling below their offering prices, said Reuters. Of the seven companies that were part of GEM at the exchange&#8217;s launch, not one was above water.</p>
<p>Oddly, in contrast to the slew of dot-com closings in the U.S., few of Hong Kong&#8217;s dot-com disasters have gone entirely out of business. The only significant failure was an online bookstore that was aiming to be the Chinese Amazon.</p>
<p>Cultural differences are one reason, says Poh Lee Tan, partner and head of the Information Technology and Communications Group at the Hong Kong office of <a href="http://www.bakerinfo.com/Main.html">Baker &#038; McKenzie</a>, a global law firm. She looks for lots of consolidation, but sees it happening in ways designed, in part, to save face for the people involved.</p>
<p>Not too many of the dot-coms are in a position to buy out others in the genre. Brick-and-mortar companies are now looking over the ailing dot-coms, but they&#8217;ll be looking more carefully than retail investors apparently did in the public markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are going to be deals,&#8221; Tan says. Potential buyers &#8220;can afford to do more due diligence, something that was seen to be a luxury only a few months ago.&#8221;</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4> Ellison Doesn&#8217;t Give Up</font></p>
<p>Two years ago, Larry Ellison announced what sounded like a fairly audacious, if entirely sensible, plan. He and computer hardware partners would sell boxes that would act as Oracle-based servers and use no Microsoft software.</p>
<p>The notion hasn&#8217;t changed, and server appliances have become big business. Oracle has hardly been a leader in the category. </p>
<p>Ellison doesn&#8217;t give up, though. In an announcement at the Comdex show in Las Vegas yesterday, Ellison <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/front/docs/oracle111400.htm">gave the scheme an upgrade</a> (Mercury News).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now bundled with Oracle 9i, the newest version of the company&#8217;s software, and has the fairly intriguing support of hardware giant Compaq Computer. The latest appliances will be Web and application servers. </p>
<p>They&#8217;re also part of Ellison&#8217;s jihad against Microsoft&#8217;s vision of client-server computing in favor of a fairly pure form of network computing. In the latter model, almost all of the intelligence &#8212; and all of the data &#8212; resides on servers, which dish out information to devices at the edge.</p>
<p>Ellison is right that personal computers are still too complicated and unreliable. He&#8217;s wrong, I suspect, if he really thinks all intelligence belongs in the center of the network.</p>
<p>The world has changed. Peer-to-peer computing, which uses the power of the machines at the edge, is making more and more sense. And it&#8217;s a lot closer to Microsoft&#8217;s vision of the world than Oracle&#8217;s. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s room for both, of course. But Oracle would be wise to look at lot harder at P2P, as it&#8217;s known. This wave is just starting to gain strength. Whether it&#8217;s a Tsunami is still unknown, but I&#8217;m not betting against it.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>A Gift for All Time</font></p>
<p>My father said there were TV Monsters. They were evil televisions, and they lurked in a dark, scary forest where they loved to gobble up little boys and girls.</p>
<p>There was a way to get past the TV Monsters. They couldn&#8217;t hurt you if you held a book in front of your face.</p>
<p>I learned to read when I was very young. I love books, which take me into realms beyond TV and even real life. I hope you&#8217;re encouraging your own kids to read. I hope you read to them.</p>
<p>Not all kids in Silicon Valley are as fortunate as I was. That&#8217;s why I strongly support the Mercury News&#8217; annual <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/special/giftofreading/">Gift of Reading</a> book drive. </p>
<p>As the holiday season approaches, please help out. You can drop books off at the newspaper or participating libraries and bookstores. Or just send money &#8212; some of you have plenty to spare &#8212; and the organizers will buy and wrap the books. Look for posters with details or call (408) 920-5755.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s show all of Silicon Valley&#8217;s kids the way past the TV Monsters.</p>

				<p>Consider:</p>
<p>
<li> Al Gore won the popular vote.</p>
<p>
<li> Al Gore almost certainly won Florida, but a poorly designed ballot in Palm Beach County led some unobservant voters to vote for Pat Buchanan instead.</p>
<p>
<li> The ballot in question was approved by Democrats.</p>
<p>
<li> Absentee ballots aren&#8217;t likely to put Gore over the top.</p>
<p>
<li> With Florida, Gore would have won the presidency.</p>
<p>
<li> Gore is pulling every possible public-relations string, and threatening paralyzing legal action, to bring Florida into his win column &#8212; a stance that worries even the people who supported him for president, because the nation is getting closer to a constitutional crisis.</p>
<p>All that is true. Now consider this:</p>
<p>
<li> George Bush, in Gore&#8217;s place, would be doing exactly the same thing that Gore is doing now. </p>
<p>
<li> Not willing to wait for the Florida recount to be finished, Bush and his surrogates keep claiming victory.</p>
<p>
<li> Now, after issuing all kinds of dark warnings against possible legal action by Gore, they&#8217;ve sued to stop Florida from hand-counting ballots.</p>
<p>Gore has disappointed many people by pushing the envelope. He should say out loud that he&#8217;ll accept the results in Florida after a recount, including the absentee ballots.</p>
<p>But Bush is making things even worse. His arrogance is disgusting.</p>
<p>Statesmanship? True love of country? Maybe in some parallel universe.</p>
<p>I still think Bush will take the oath of office in January. But when he swears to &#8220;preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,&#8221; I&#8217;ll have trouble believing he means it.</p>

				<p>We measure leaders by the way they respond to crisis. Maybe my perspective, from this distant shore, is too removed from the scene in the United States to be trusted. But as I watch the way George W. Bush and Al Gore have responded to this test with an increasingly sinking feeling.</p>
<p>I voted for Gore. I expect Bush to be the next president, because I think when the absentee ballots in Florida are counted we&#8217;ll discover that he won a flawed &#8212; but not fraudulent &#8212; election. </p>
<p>Gore is absolutely right to wait for the absentee ballots to arrive and be counted before letting Florida go. But he will destroy his career, and tear the political fabric of our nation, if he or his surrogates pursue legal challenges to the ballot in Palm Beach County. The ballot was badly designed. It was a mistake, but it was blessed by Democratic officials before the election. We should not overturn elections because of mistakes that were not deliberately designed to sway votes.</p>
<p>Bush, for his part, is behaving outrageously. Not content to wait for all the ballots, he is trying to achieve squatter&#8217;s rights on the election. He believes he can claim victory prematurely and make it so, just as he thinks he can claim falsely to be a &#8220;compassionate conservative&#8221; and make that so.</p>
<p>Unless Bush and Gore summon the kind of courage &#8212; the kind of leadership qualities &#8212; that America needs <i>right now</i>, they will be leading us into a constitutional crisis of the worst kind. Today, they are in a poisonous race toward the gutter. </p>
<p>Based on their behavior so far, Bush and Gore are guaranteeing something neither should want. Barring an improvement in leadership, whoever takes office next January will be viewed, quite properly, as an barely legitimate president.</p>
<p>That isn&#8217;t something any of us should want.</p>

				<p>They looked at me like I was, well, just a bit crazy.</p>
<p>They were my students at the University of Hong Kong&#8217;s <a href="http://jmsc.hku.hk">Journalism and Media Studies Centre</a> &#8212; a bright and capable group who&#8217;d assembled for the first of five weekly seminars. The topic of the class is technology journalism. </p>
<p>But for more than a half hour at the beginning of last night&#8217;s session, the topic was <a href="http://www.allpolitics.com">American politics</a>. </p>
<p>I was trying to help them understand the <a href="http://www.nara.gov/fedreg/elctcoll/">Electoral College</a> system that has thrown the 2000 presidential election into such chaos. They found my explanations odd, but they wanted to understand.</p>
<p>I tried to explain. We apportion electoral votes based on a state&#8217;s total representation in Congress, both House and Senate, I said. And we give the popular-vote winner all of a state&#8217;s electoral votes &#8212; except in the two states where we don&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mess, I told them. They nodded in strong agreement.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>America, America: Next Steps</font></p>
<p>So what do we do about this mess?</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be hearing and reading a variety of remedies in coming days and months. Clearly we need to upgrade the system by, first of all, doing away with the <a href="http://www.nara.gov/fedreg/elctcoll/">Electoral College</a>, an anachronism that has been shown conclusively to create all kinds of trouble with almost no advantages.</p>
<p>Bad design seems to have played a role with the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/09/election.president/large.ballot.ap.jpg">ballot in Palm Beach County</a>, Florida, that plainly confused a large number of people into voting for Pat Buchanan instead of Al Gore.</p>
<p>To understand how unnecessarily stupid this was &#8212; and why usability testing, a staple in some product-design circles, would have avoided this disaster &#8212; see software pioneer Dan Bricklin&#8217;s <a href="http://danbricklin.com/log/ballotusability.htm">detailed explanation</a>.</p>
<p>Another needed upgrade is in the physical voting machines. We should require all communities to install standardized machines that tabulate ballots into a database and are connected via networks to the office of the Secretary of State in each of the states, or the equivalent office overseeing voting. Then we&#8217;d have instant results when the polls closed, and we wouldn&#8217;t put ourselves through this kind of madness.</p>
<p>Expensive? Sure. But this is something we, the taxpayers, should pay for on a national basis. The voting franchise is too valuable to our lives to leave to 19th century technology.</p>
<p>We shouldn&#8217;t settle on a single kind of machine. Rather, to promote competition, we should create a standardized platform, if you will, that vendors could bid to provide to individual localities.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another &#8220;solution&#8221; some in the tech community are touting &#8212; a rapid adoption of Internet voting. This is an absolutely terrible idea in the near term, and only marginally acceptable over the long term. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll need a major amount of convincing that any online system could both provide the necessary security against fraud and simultaneously save the secret ballot, a cornerstone of democracy. I&#8217;ll need even more convincing that we can prevent the literal stealing of elections by hackers.</p>
<p>Besides, the act of voting &#8212; going to a polling place and casting a ballot &#8212; strikes me as a civic and personal good. I&#8217;m not wedded to that notion; the state of Oregon mailed ballots to its citizens this year, with good results. But holding the ballot in your hands as you make these awesome decisions has enormous meaning, at least to me.</p>
<p>Did you vote? I did.</p>

<p><font size=4>Gates Takes on the Tech Industry</font></p>
<p>New York Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/03/technology/03GATE.html">Bill Gates Turns Skeptical on Digital Solution&#8217;s Scope</a>. <i>&#8220;I mean, do people have a clear view of what it means to live on $1 a day?&#8221; the speaker, William H. Gates, asked. &#8220;There&#8217;s no electricity in that house. None.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Listen to him on this.</p>
<p>Bill Gates is a relentlessly logical man. That quality has gotten him into trouble as a business person, but when it comes to philanthropy, it&#8217;s going to be one of the reasons he will go down in history with as many allocades as brickbats.</p>
<p>Gates has dared to tell the technology establishment to grow up, to recognize that Moore&#8217;s Law won&#8217;t cure poverty or feed the hungry. It will help, someday, but much of the globe&#8217;s population needs real help, now, not possibly illusory help from computer mavens in five or ten years.</p>
<p>The response from Sun Microsystems&#8217; John Gage, a man I admire, is disappointing. I wonder if Gage is so wrapped up in Sun&#8217;s institutional loathing of Microsoft that he has to find something bad to say about Gates. No, that&#8217;s probably unfair. But Gage&#8217;s mutterings don&#8217;t parse for me.</p>
<p>Who might have thought Bill Gates would turn, even in a small way, into the conscience of the technology world? Whatever is going on here, on this he deserves applause.</p></blockquote>

<p><font size=4>Napster and the Record Industry</font> </p>
<p><a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/top/docs/nap110100.htm">Napster&#8217;s deal with Bertelsmann AG</a> (Mercury News) is, on balance, a step in the right direction. But I don&#8217;t understand how it changes very much in this debate.</p>
<p>First of all, the deal is more prospective &#8212; and vague &#8212; than real. It assumes Napster will be able to come up with a technology that lets music-listeners download the songs they like in a form that will still protect copyrights, yet preserve what makes Napster so useful to its users. It also wants people to pay $5 a month for the music.</p>
<p>Second, it assumes that Napster will lose its legal battle with the record industry. I tend to believe it will, but a Napster victory would make it unnecessary to have such a deal with the industry.</p>
<p>Third, this assumes the industry will persuade the artists to comply. Keep in mind that the major record labels have done nothing but anger the musicians over the years. The artists may want to strike their own online deals.</p>
<p>Finally, today&#8217;s Napster users will simply migrate to another file-sharing service that doesn&#8217;t charge. Anyone who thinks that &#8220;free music&#8221; isn&#8217;t the major attraction of Napster hasn&#8217;t been paying attention. I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s a good thing &#8212; the artists deserve to be rewarded for their work, contrary to the music-must-be-free mantra you hear so often these days &#8212; but it&#8217;s reality.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to watch.</p>

<p><font size=4>Halloween and the Election</font> </p>
<p>I&#8217;m scared.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m scared because the United States, a nation I love, is about to elect the most <a href="http://slate.msn.com/Readme/00-10-23/Readme.asp">unqualified and/or intellectually dishonest</a> president in this century.</p>
<p>Because his chief opponent <a href="http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A53200-2000Oct31.html">has squandered his opportunity</a> by pandering and worse.</p>
<p>Because an egomanicial third-party candidate who surely knows better sees no problem in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/01/politics/01COUN.html">helping elect</a> the candidate whose positions are least like his own. When women lose their right to decide their own reproductive futures, they may want to ask Ralph Nader for an explanation.</p>
<p>Because the media covering the election, more interested in <a href="http://washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/polls/2000tracking.htm">tracking polls</a> than issues, are too lazy or frightened of the consequences to <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/483554.asp">tell the truth</a> about the likely winner, or even <a href="http://www.examiner.com/001030/1030sorensen.html">probe some extraordinarily damaging accusations</a>.</p>
<p>Because we have let wealth and power overwhelm all other considerations. Our political system has truly become &#8221; one dollar, one vote&#8221; &#8212; a national travesty that should shame us.</p>
<p>Because the voting public has chosen to be oblivious to reality.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m casting my absentee ballot today, and will be in Asia next week. I&#8217;m not looking forward to this Election Day.</p>
<p>This one scares me.</p>
