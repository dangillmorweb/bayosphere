				<p>It&#8217;s been another amazing year in Silicon Valley and the tech world at large, full of highlights and lowlights. My <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg122199.htm">Tuesday column</a> lists the former, as I see them.</p>
<p>What do you think were the tech lowlights of the year? What companies and/or executives screwed up? What government types made our lives worse? <span class="email-removed" title="email address removed">Let me know.</span></p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Tripping Linda</font></p>
<p>Tripp: <i>verb</i>, to betray a friendship, typically by means of surreptitious surveillance, esp. audio tape.</p>
<p>Linda Tripp&#8217;s last name has become a verb, and an ugly one. For the rest of her life, her name will be synonymous with betrayal. What she did was loathesome.</p>
<p>Now she&#8217;s being prosecuted, in a plainly political way, for her acts. Yes, she broke the law. And yes, we need laws to protect privacy. But when politics turns into prosecution, we are all in danger.</p>
<p>The one benefit of this case is the attention it&#8217;s drawn. As William Safire said in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/opinion/safire/122099safi.html">recent New York Times column</a> (free registration required), &#8220;The famous Tripp taping of her conversations with Monica, further publicized by this witch hunt in Maryland, may do a lot of good for privacy in America.&#8221;	</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s be clear: This <i>is</i> a witch hunt. The state charges are improper because they are political, and because Tripp is being singled out for a crime that is almost never prosecuted. If she is convicted, the Maryland prosecutors should stop right there and ask for no jail time or fine. Tripp has been punished enough.</p>

				<p>The state of Virginia is <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/op/xml/99/12/20/991220opfoster.xml">moving with unseemly haste</a> toward passage of UCITA, the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, a proposed state law that would utterly destroy the few protections now available to software customers. With the same disregard to customers&#8217; rights that has been a hallmark of the entire UCITA process, Virginia proponents have put this travesty on a fast track, reports Infoworld&#8217;s Ed Foster.</p>
<p>UCITA is one of the most grossly anti-consumer measures ever proposed. If enacted by the various states, UCITA would skew the relationship between sellers and buyers of software,whether you buy software out of a box or online. It might also end up governing electronic commerce transactions in the future. The balance, already on the side of sellers, would lean much further in that direction.</p>
<p>If you live in Virginia, do what you can to stop this. And be ready, in whatever state you reside, to fight for your rights as a customer when this pernicious legislation arrives at your capital.</p>

<p><font size=4>Richard Stallman: Boycott Amazon.com</font></p>
<p>Richard Stallman, the founder of the <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>, has an issue with Amazon.com&#8217;s assertion of patent rights against Barnes &#038; Noble&#8217;s online store. In short, Amazon has won a patent on something that should have been laughed out of the offices of the U.S. Patent and Tradmark Office (USPTO).</p>
<p>The patent examiners are overworked, underpaid and, in too many cases, grossly undertrained. They grant patents on &#8220;inventions&#8221; that are ridiculously obvious and should never have even been filed. The courts, meanwhile, have allowed too many of these to stand.</p>
<p>The system begs for abuse. Individuals and companies win absurd patents and then try to block other people from doing business or, in some cases, try to extort money from so-called violators. Congress is willfully oblivious to the damage the system will do to our economy over time.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with Amazon? Plenty, as I mentioned at the top. Amazon&#8217;s patent on its &#8220;one-click checkout&#8221; is beyond absurd. By suing Barnes &#038; Noble, Amazon has shown itself to be just another monopolist wannabe. It doesn&#8217;t deserve your business.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t buy <a href="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/amazon.html">Stallman&#8217;s entire argument</a> in this matter. But on the fundamental point &#8212; Amazon&#8217;s threat to e-commerce in general &#8212; he is exactly right. </p>
<p>Boycott Amazon, until it drops this legal outrage.</p>

				<p>The senior class at a private school in Palo Alto has been the scene of an interesting experiment this fall. The members of the class, plus their teachers, were loaned Palm VII handheld organizers, the models that include wireless data communications.</p>
<p>I stopped by for a quick visit, and in my <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg121999.htm">Sunday column</a> I tell what I found.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Linux is getting Creative</font></p>
<p>One of the big problems with Linux has been not-so-hot support for the kinds of peripheral hardware home computers users tend to favor. And one of the big gaps in that area has been iffy support (at best) for Creative Technologies&#8217; incredibly popular sound cards and other multimedia gear.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s changing, according to this <a href="http://www.creative-asia.com/press/1999/p991216b.html">press release</a>. Creative is <a href="http://www.creative-asia.com/press/1999/p991216a.html">working with Corel Corp.</a> on this enhanced Linux support. If the company follows through on its promises, this will be a very big deal for the platform.</p>

				<span class="meta-prep meta-prep-author">Posted on</span> <a href="http://bayosphere.com/1999/12/17/privacy-policies-why-bother/" title="12:00 pm" rel="bookmark"><span class="entry-date">December 17, 1999</span></a> <span class="meta-sep">by</span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="http://bayosphere.com/author/dan-gillmor/" title="View all posts by Dan Gillmor">Dan Gillmor</a></span>			</div><!-- .entry-meta -->

				<p>The Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington surveyed the top 100 cyber-shopping sites on the Web. <a href="http://www.epic.org/reports/surfer-beware3.html">The results</a> will come as a surprise only to people who think online companies actually care about protecting consumers&#8217; privacy. </p>
<p>In reality, abusing consumers&#8217; privacy is an integral part of the standard e-business model these days. Posting a privacy policy that means nothing is only slightly better than not posting one at all.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>As the report says: <i>&#8220;Taken as a whole, we found that more sites are posting privacy policies than did when we conducted the first formal review of website policies in 1997. We have also seen the rise of new associations to promote the development of privacy policies and encourage industry awareness of privacy issues. But when we looked closely at these policies, we found that they typically lacked the necessary elements of Fair Information Practices and were unlikely to provide meaningful privacy protection for consumers. The presence of a privacy policy, unfortunately, does not always ensure privacy protection.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>More on eToy(s) and Domain Names</font></p>
<p>I took a shot at eToys the other day for its <a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/1999/12/15">unfair treatment</a> of a site called eToy. eToys, an online toy store, hasn&#8217;t been around nearly as long as eToy, an artist hangout, but that didn&#8217;t stop the retailer from suing to block the artists from using their domain name. </p>
<p>My advice remains: Don&#8217;t shop at eToys until it does the right thing, which is to back off its outrageous behavior.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Network Solutions Inc., the domain-name monopolist that makes Microsoft seem gentle and kind by comparison, has <a href=http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,33111,00.html">blocked e-mail</a> (Wired News story) to the eToy folks. Whether NSI had the right to do this is questionable, but hey, being a monopoly means never having to say you&#8217;re sorry.</p>
<p>The domain name system is broken. It&#8217;s a disaster area that Congress and the White House recently made worse with a new, &#8220;anti-cybersquatting&#8221; law that gives big businesses all the power they need to run roughshod over smaller entities in the domain-name space. </p>
<p>After I posted my first eToys piece here, I heard from two of the most thoughtful observers of the Net &#8212; and of technology in general &#8212; Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston. Their credentials? Well, they wrote VisiCalc, the first electronic spreadsheet, back in the late 1970s. That software, more than any other product, legitimized personal computers.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>&#8220;The real problem,&#8221; Bob wrote, &#8220;is not whether trademarks get screwed up. It&#8217;s utterly clueless people getting involved in the glue that holds the net and, now, our economy, together. That&#8217;s the real danger! I&#8217;m less upset at eToys. The problem is those who have made .COM the gating factor in the universe! In fact, we should say that in 2006 all .COM addresses will be decommissioned and legacy URLs will have to be converted to a meaningless name. (Yes, I know that isn&#8217;t feasible). People can already use directories that reflect the complex realities of finding &#8220;Joe&#8217;s Pizza&#8221; and not be so focused on the convenience of BigCo&#8217;s establishing brand names and funding legacy television advertising.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob also sent a link to <a href="http://www.frankston.com/public/essays/DNSSafeHaven.asp"> his essay</a> on the subject.</p>
<p>Dan&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bricklin.com/tmdns.htm">essay on the topic</a> is equally interesting.</p></blockquote>

				<p>Patrick Naughton, the former Infoseek/Disney executive, may have gotten what he deserved in his trial in L.A. &#8212; <a href="http://www.sjmercury.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/naught121799.htm">a conviction</a> on the charge of possessing child pornography but a hung jury on the more serious counts of using the Internet to arrange sexual relations with a minor and then crossing state lines for that purpose. The prosecution should quit while it&#8217;s ahead.</p>
<p>You may suspect that Naughton was guilty of all three charges. His defense &#8212; that he was only fantasizing with no intention to pursue sex with a minor &#8212; was more than a little hard to swallow.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re already hearing &#8212; in online conversations, naturally &#8212; that the hung jury is a license for pedophiles to do their vicious stuff. Baloney. Anyone foolish enough to use cyberspace to lure minors into sexual contact is inviting law enforcement&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad the cops are working hard to keep predators away from our kids. But law enforcement&#8217;s behavior in this case may have been one reason the jury couldn&#8217;t make a decision on the harsher chargers. Not only was Naughton&#8217;s intent unclear, but the government went to amazing lengths to lead their quarry into the snare.</p>
<p>Entrapment is ugly business. The government sometimes helps create criminals out of people who would not take that final step into wrongdoing if they weren&#8217;t handed the opportunity on a platter.</p>
<p>Juries recognize government misbehavior, and they often find ways not to reward it. They also don&#8217;t want to reward wrongdoers.</p>
<p>Naughton&#8217;s life has been turned inside out by this trial and verdict, even without a conviction on the most serious charges. Maybe, in the end, he got a kind of rough justice</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Red Hat Buying Be?</font></p>
<p>That&#8217;s <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-1498509.html?tag=st.ne.1002.bgif.1003-200-1498509">the rumor</a>, according to Bloomberg News. If true, this could be interesting &#8212; adding Be&#8217;s wonderful multimedia capabilities to Linux. </p>
<p>If it&#8217;s true, however, somebody should go to jail for insider trading. Be&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dbc.com/forms/squote.htx?source=blq%2FSJMercury&#038;tables=table&#038;TICKER=beos">share price</a> went up almost 50 percent on Thursday.</p>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee got <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/internet/docs/1570l.htm">a major award</a> today. No one deserves it more.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Wall Street Shows its Spots</font></p>
<p>In a conversation with this newspaper a couple of weeks ago, Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s chief executive, Carly Fiorina, repeatedly used the word &#8220;analysts&#8221; &#8212; and in that context, the analysts were proxies for shareholders generally. Fiorina was reflecting the current situation, where companies kow-tow to Wall Street big investment banks and stock traders.</p>
<p>But the system has become jaded, even corrupt in some cases. Most analysts are not proxies for you and me &#8212; smaller shareholders. They&#8217;re proxies for the big institutions who get to act early on news told first to the analysts and later, if ever, to the rest of us. Some investment bank analysts, meanwhile, have become little more than shills for their firms, which crave the big commissions they can earn when underwriting public offerings and advising on other deals. Analysts almost never write negative reports on the companies with which their firms do business.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission, at long last, has offered the mildest of proposals to make disclosure more fair to all investors. Predictably, as the <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/sec121699.htm">New York Times reports</a>, Wall Street is in a tizzy, trying to block even these slight improvements in making flow of information more fair.</p>
<p>Recently, I declined to attend a press and analyst briefing at Cisco Systems, because it was on the record for the analysts &#8212; who, in a sense, are nothing more than journalists for the rich (even if the analysts seem often to be in bed with the companies they cover) &#8212; and off the record for regular journalists. The analysts&#8217; clients traded on information given to the analysts. If you weren&#8217;t a client you were in the dark. It was a disgusting charade. And it should have been illegal.</p>
<p>But Wall Street has always liked to rig the game. Let&#8217;s hope the SEC makes some progress here.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.etoys.com">eToys</a>, the online toy store, sued <a href="http://146.228.204.72:8080">eToy</a>, a site maintained by a bunch of Europe-based artists. The fact that eToy had been around on the Web much longer than eToys didn&#8217;t bother a U.S. judge, who issued an injunction to shut down the eToy domain.  eToys should be ashamed of itself, but shamelessness is a hallmark of many companies, online and off.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>News coverage:<br /><a href="http://www.thestandard.com/article/display/0,1151,8205,00.html">Industry Standard</a> article<br /><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/intweek/stories/news/0,4164,2408451,00.html">Interactive Week</a> article</p></blockquote>
<p>Some online activists, while properly incensed at the company&#8217;s arrogance, are taking their objections a bit far. <a href="http://www.rtmark.com">RTMark</a>, for example, is calling for Netizens <a href="http://www.rtmark.com/etoypr.html">to essentially destroy eToys</a> by various means, including an open-ended invitation to hackers. This is a vigilante response, and it won&#8217;t win any friends for the good guys.</p>
<p>The best response, which RTMark <a href="http://www.rtmark.com/etoysnot.html">also endorses</a> (as do many other activist sites), is to shop elsewhere and <a href="http://www.etoys.com/cgi-bin/cs_print_page.cgi?menupage=1&#038;pagename=t10">make your feelings known</a> to eToys.</p>
<p>This entire case, incidentally, is part of an emerging disaster area on the Net. The rich and powerful are taking control of &#8220;their&#8221; names even when other people <i>with equally good claims</i> have already registered the domain names. The law, as so often happens, has been rewritten to favor the rich and powerful.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on a column on this topic. I&#8217;d like to hear <span class="email-removed" title="email address removed">your ideas</span> on what we can do about it.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>How Late is Windows 2000?</font></p>
<p>It&#8217;s official: Microsoft said today that <a href="http://www.sjmercury.com/svtech/news/breaking/ap/docs/1191849l.htm">Windows 2000 is &#8220;done&#8221;</a> (AP story) &#8212; that is, close enough to finished to release the product to manufacturing and sell it. Of course, as with any new operating system, anyone with any sense will wait at least six months before installing this behemoth, with its tens of millions of lines of code. I&#8217;ll probably put it on one machine, just to see how it works, but not a computer I need for everyday work.</p>
<p>The W2K charade &#8212; saying it&#8217;s finished means Microsoft will now claim it did this before the turn of the century, despite being years late already &#8212; has been pretty amusing. But the tardiness of this product has had absolutely no real impact on Microsoft. This is the benefit of a monopoly &#8212; you can deliver a product when you feel like it.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Behind the Photo Curve</font></p>
<p>Professional photographers say I&#8217;m behind the curve for only recently <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg121499.htm">discovering digital photography</a>. Fine. I&#8217;m not a professional photographer.</p>
<p>But I suspect I&#8217;m in the same boat as millions of other folks who have learned what a nifty new tool this is. And when you add the Internet to the equation, it gets a lot more interesting.</p>

				<p>If you have excellent Linux skills, Microsoft wants you. Four of you, anyway, according to the <a href="http://microsoft.com/jobs/search/viewJobs.asp?Mode=showinframe&#038;page=1&#038;msid1=-1993357609&#038;msid2=-1823323203&#038;msid3=-1677215145&#038;msid4=1500258441">job listings</a> Tuesday at the company&#8217;s Web site.</p>

<p><font size=4>Does $50 Buy Privacy?</font></p>
<p>It may well, if you&#8217;re sending your money to <a href="http://www.zeroknowledge.com/">Zero-Knowledge Systems</a>, a Canadian company that offers anonymity on the Net. I&#8217;ve just subscribed to the <a href="http://www.sjmercury.com/svtech/news/indepth/docs/secret121499.htm">Freedom service</a>, and I&#8217;ll be letting you know how it works.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a genuine debate surrounding this product, and it&#8217;s all about anonymity. Yes, it&#8217;s a way to cause trouble. And yes, it can be a way to hide criminal activities.</p>
<p>But the value of anonymity, not to mention the free-speech factor, is far higher than the problems it may cause. Jonathan Wallace at the Cato Institute has written <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/briefs/bp-054es.html">an essay</a> on the topic, and I encourage you to read it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written a fair amount on this in the past as well. Here&#8217;s an excerpt from a column last February:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>&#8220;We all have the right to hold unpopular views, to be different. That&#8217;s what they told us in school, right?</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually, this theoretical right has always been subject to conditions. In the real world, it&#8217;s fine to believe in something most people consider crazy or wrong, or to have an illness or condition that frightens other people, as long as you don&#8217;t talk about it too publicly. We tend to be a society of angst-ridden conformists, shunning those on the edges whether they&#8217;re promoting bizarre notions or trying to find support.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Internet has given voice to the people at the edges. They form communities of ideas, gripes and common experiences, physically scattered but able to coalesce in the vastness of cyberspace.</p>
<p>&#8220;What someone says in a 12-step program stays there. What someone says on the Net generally becomes available to anyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s the best reason to consider the value, not just the threat, of an upcoming software product called Freedom, from Montreal-based Zero-Knowledge Systems Inc.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
