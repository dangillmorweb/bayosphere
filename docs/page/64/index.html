				<p>Good news from the <a href="http://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation&#8217;s</a> Will Doherty regarding the outrageous <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,45342,00.html">arrest of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Congratulations folks!
<p>The pressure we all have put on Adobe has resulted<br />in an agreement to meet with representatives from<br />the Electronic Frontier Foundation on this Monday<br />morning, July 23.
</p>
<p>For that reason, EFF has decided to:
</p>
<p>PUT THE JULY 23 PROTEST ON HOLD
</p>
<p>Please help us act in good faith and postpone the<br />protest until we have a chance to negotiate with<br />Adobe.
</p>
<p>Of course, we can always rekindle the protest if<br />Adobe does not agree to withdraw their complaint<br />to the US Department of Justice regarding Dmitry<br />Sklyarov and to refuse to pursue further prosecutions<br />under the DMCA for cases that should be prevented<br />under fair use provisions of US copyright law.
</p>
<p>And also, if the US Attorney&#8217;s office insists<br />on prosecuting Dmitry without a current complaint<br />from Adobe, then we will continue protests directed<br />at them rather than at Adobe.
</p>
<p>If you still feel that you have to protest on<br />Monday, you are of course free to do so.<br />However, it may be a more effective use of<br />our collective energies to act in a coordinated<br />way to get Dmitry out of jail.

				<p>Because some of you did speak up to your state-government representatives, Californians may be on the verge of regaining a key bit of privacy in how big companies handle their personal financial information.
</p>
<p>   Earlier this week, the state Assembly Banking and Finance Committee reversed an earlier vote and passed SB 773, which would prohibit financial institutions not to peddle or share data with third parties without customers&#8217; permission. And customers could tell them not to share data with affiliate companies or business units.
</p>
<p>   If the legislation makes it through two more committees and gets the governor&#8217;s signature, California will take the national lead on privacy. That will be a proud day.
</p>
<p>   The bill&#8217;s sponsor, state Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, told the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/17/MN163347.DTL">San Francisco Chronicle</a> that vocal public support for the bill made the difference in the committee. If your call or letter helped make this happen, pat yourself on the back.

				<p>Today&#8217;s Mercury News <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/personaltech/">Personal Technology</a> section offers a <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/docs/news/ptech/spnd071901.htm">long list of suggestions</a> on how to spend (or not) the special U.S. tax rebate that will soon be in the mail.
</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I suggested:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Invest your tax refund in something that will pay real dividends in coming years &#8212; your rights in the Digital Age.Big Government and Big Business fear technology and cyberspace more than most people understand. Both are working to control it. If they win, you&#8217;ll lose some traditional liberties &#8212; and they&#8217;ll be difficult to reclaim.
<p>On the front lines, combatting the governmental and corporate control freaks, are organizations that could use your financial help. Here are three, among many others:
</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> has taken on some of the most important issues in recent years. The EFF is currently leading the battle to protect prevent the entertainment industry from using copyright law to destroy &#8220;fair use&#8221; of the music, books and other content you buy.
</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> works to preserve liberty every day. The Bill of Rights is under constant attack, and no organization has worked harder to keep the Constitution alive than the ACLU.
</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.epic.org">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> monitors and tries to combat the ongoing threats to our privacy.
</p>
<p>Support these worthy groups. Invest in your rights.<br />

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>A group led by <a href="http://www.shirky.com">Clay Shirky</a> and <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/oreilly/tim_bio.html">Tim O&#8217;Reilly</a> has issued <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/news/jvm_0701.html">a challenge to the manufacturers of Intel-compatible personal computers</a>. It&#8217;s a direct result of two events &#8212; Microsoft&#8217;s <a HREF="http://www.siliconvalley.com/docs/opinion/dgillmor/dg071201.htm">supposed liberalization</a> of its licensing practices, allowing PC makers more flexibility in what they can put on their desktops; and Microsoft&#8217;s announcement this week that it&#8217;s <a HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2790355,00.html?chkpt=zdnn_tp_">removing Java support</a> from the next version of Windows it ships.
</p>
<p>The challenge will be simple. Backers, of whom I&#8217;m one, will request that the PC makers bundle the latest <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/">Java Runtime Environment</a> (JRE) with their computers.
</p>
<p>This is a move with little or no cost for the OEMs but tremendous potential benefits for their customers. Microsoft is trying to reduce diversity in computing. Java is one way to maintain the little that&#8217;s left, and maybe grow it.
</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen the final draft of the challenge the participants are issuing to the PC makers, but the one I did see notes that thousands of Java programmers have already written software that runs in multiple environments. Much of this is server software, but given the degree to which PCs are starting to act like servers this is a distinction that matters less every day. The draft says:
</p>
<blockquote><p><i>It is essential that a Java Virtual Machine continue to be an integral part of the basic installation of all personal computers.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>
<p>In the end, Microsoft may have done PC users a favor. PCs today are bundled with Microsoft&#8217;s polluted version of Java. If the PC makers can agree to accept the latest JRE, which <a href="http://java.sun.com">Sun</a> and Java supporters &#8212; <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/">IBM</a> among them &#8212; have been upgrading, we might see a time when we have a consistent Java environment on new PCs.
</p>
<p>This will be a test of the manufacturers. If they&#8217;re truly out from under the thumb of Microsoft, they&#8217;ll do this. If they are not, they won&#8217;t.
</p>
<p>UPDATES:</p>
<p>Dave Winer <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/07/19">doesn&#8217;t buy it</a>. He writes, in an e-mail:
</p>
<blockquote><p><i>I totally disagree with Dan&#8217;s conclusion.
<p>What if I said the best thing that could happen to all of us is a complete <br />backoff of all the bundling beyond what&#8217;s specified in the W3C definition of <br />the Web. Take Flash out. Take Java out. Take all the weird plug-ins out. <br />Just a pure Web, without any marketing schemes and industry warfare. (And <br />while you&#8217;re at it spin the browser out of Microsoft.)
</p>
<p>Is that worth thinking about?
</p>
<p>As a person who creates software for the Internet, I think it is.
</p>
<p>And as a person who writes for the Internet, I like it.
</p>
<p>It got too complicated. Let&#8217;s simplify.
</p>
<p>Goodbye Java in the browser.
<p></i></p></blockquote>
<p>Clay Shirky responds:
</p>
<blockquote><p><i>It is worth thinking about, of course, but where I think I disagree is doing it in half steps. I&#8217;d be happy to see a clean W3C browser, if you also took the step of spinning the browser of MSFT. A clean browser without taking the steps you outlined in your earlier piece about browser competition seems to give MSFT more leverage, since they can load all the installers in the OS, while the Adobe&#8217;s and Macromedias of the world can&#8217;t.
<p>Allowing every user to decide to install PDF support individually, in <br />other words, might make sense, but only if no one data format has any <br />advantage over any other. </i><br />
</blockquote>
<p>Dave responds to that:
</p>
<blockquote><p><i>What&#8217;s really interesting is that the technology has advanced to make this kind of stuff really easy.
<p>Microsoft does updating over the network now. UserLand has been doing it for <br />three years. Red Hat has been quietly rebuilding their software distribution <br />network around XML-RPC. The art here has quietly been advancing. We can make <br />it easy for you to jump from one world to another, without forcing the kind <br />of integration that happened in the last few years. We can build better user <br />experiences with the new power we have.
</p>
<p>Macromedia should do a browser around Flash, defining a Web that is totally <br />high production value. I&#8217;ve been saying that to them since Flash came out. <br />Yes they want to be in the browser, but I want them out. It&#8217;s jarring to hit <br />the Flash web through the HTML web. Flash defines a commercial Web, no doubt <br />some people are interested in it. It&#8217;s like having a circus clown at a <br />symphony sometimes. I&#8217;m busy thinking and some freakin ad starts yelling at <br />me. Hellp.
</p>
<p>Likewise there should be a PDF web, and I want to do an outline web. The key <br />is being able to transition. No mysteries there. My email client knows how <br />to open a URL on the web. There&#8217;s no reason the Web can&#8217;t open a Flash <br />movie, an outline, or a Java applet &#8212; without having the runtime <br />pre-installed, and that includes the HTML browser.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fluid time now. Remember a couple of weeks ago how unthinkable it <br />would have been that MS would let people see the source of .NET. I think <br />it&#8217;s so fluid that we could really change things for the better. </p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>As you may know, a group led by <a href="http://www.shirky.com">Clay Shirky</a> and <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/oreilly/tim_bio.html">Tim O&#8217;Reilly</a> has issued <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/news/jvm_0701.html">a challenge to the manufacturers of Intel-compatible personal computers</a> &#8212; put the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on all new PCs.</p>
<p>The call to arms is a result of Microsoft&#8217;s <a HREF="http://www.siliconvalley.com/docs/opinion/dgillmor/dg071201.htm">supposed liberalization</a> of its licensing practices, allowing PC makers more flexibility in what they can put on their desktops; and Microsoft&#8217;s announcement this week that it&#8217;s <a HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2790355,00.html?chkpt=zdnn_tp_">removing Java support</a> from the next version of Windows it ships.
</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://web.siliconvalley.com/content/sv/2001/07/19/opinion/dgillmor/weblog/index.htm">eJournal</a> discussed this idea. Today, Slashdot <a HREF="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/07/20/1127248">linked to it</a>, sparking the usual amazing discussion.
</p>
<p>Two of the replies, which Clay noted in an e-mail, are particularly pertinent.
</p>
<p>
<li>The JRE <a HREF="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=01/07/20/1127248&#038;cid=93">isn&#8217;t freely re-distributable</a>, notes one person.
<li>And it&#8217;s <a HREF="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=01/07/20/1127248&#038;cid=32">not that easy</a> to do, in part because Sun is not all that friendly to the OEMs for its own reasons.
</p>
<p>I also heard from Adam <a HREF="http://www.proudlyserving.com/">&#8220;Proudly Serving&#8221;</a> Barr, who said:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote><i>My argument is not 100% serious, but really you could take what people<br />said about the browser and say it about Java: It&#8217;s bad that Microsoft bundles<br />Java with the OS, removing Java will create a robust environment for<br />different Java VM implementations to flourish, people can easily download<br />free Java runtimes off the net, and so on.
<p>But then you say you want everyone to have one single VM for consistency.<br />So why is it then bad to have one single browser for consistency? You could<br />argue that in the market for Java VMs, Sun is a monopoly, and they are using<br />that monopoly to extend their control of other parts of computing etc etc etc etc.
<p></i></p></blockquote>
<p>There are two fairly easy answer to this. First, Sun isn&#8217;t the only company doing JVMs &#8212; IBM does an excellent job on this.
</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a cop-out, of course. Ultimately we don&#8217;t want to remain in today&#8217;s current write-once-debug-everywhere world of Java applets. We need stability and consistency.
</p>
<p>I guess I&#8217;d rather see two monopolists &#8212; actual and wannabe in this case &#8212; offering their APIs to the world. That&#8217;s a better alternative than what we have today.
</p>
<p>Looks like the next move is up to Sun, which is also known for its control-freak behavior and desire to lock in users on its own stuff. Should Java go open source? That would help. I won&#8217;t hold my breath.
</p>
<p><i>By the way, several /. posters pointed out that I was pointing to JRE 1.2, not 1.3. That&#8217;s fixed now. The Web&#8217;s feedback mechanism is a wonderful phenomenon&#8230;</i>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Wall Street Journal: <a HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2790355,00.html?chkpt=zdnn_tp_">Microsoft pulls back on Java support</a>. <i>The decision to drop Java support from Windows XP was first apparent last week in a &#8220;beta&#8221; or test version that Microsoft released to software developers. Java &#8220;virtual machine&#8221; code, which is what runs Web-based Java programs, had been included in all previous versions. Microsoft didn&#8217;t announce the change. <br /></i>
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The shoes just keep dropping, don&#8217;t they.
</p>
<p>Microsoft seems determined to show that it&#8217;s not only maintaining its standard business practices but stepping up the nastiness. Why the company, on the eve of the launch of Windows XP, would be this arrogant is something of a mystery.
</p>
<p>Then again, Microsoft knows no other way to behave.
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<li>Marc Hedlund says <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/478">&#8220;So what?&#8221;</a>.
<li>David Harrah, a <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a> PR spokesman at Sun Microsystems, challenges Marc&#8217;s contention that there aren&#8217;t many sites using Java applets.
<p>
<blockquote><i>&#8220;Thought it <br />might interest you to know that one of our guys ran a hotbot this morning, which <br />identified 7,189,200 web pages with embedded Java applets. Many are consumer <br />oriented sites.</i>
</p>
<p><i>&#8220;In looking at only 100+ of those I found the following<br />consumer visible sites:
<p></i></p>
<p><i>NYSE</p>
<p>Cannon</p>
<p>PGA</p>
<p>Citrix</p>
<p>Bell South</p>
<p>Delloite and Touche</p>
<p>SBC</p>
<p>Airbus</p>
<p>Johnson and Johnson</p>
<p>NHL</p>
<p>Hyundi</p>
<p>Small Business Affairs</p>
<p>Social Security Administration</p>
<p>Associated Press</p>
<p>NAACP</p>
<p>BMW</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG</p>
<p>US Census Bureau</p>
<p></i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;While plugs-in are a no-brainer for O&#8217;Reilly readers, I don&#8217;t think the average <br />consumer is well-served by Microsoft on this &#8212; even if only symbolically.  I am, <br />however, biased on the subject ;-)&#8221;</i><br />

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Dave Winer, after reading <a HREF="http://web.siliconvalley.com/content/sv/2001/07/16/opinion/dgillmor/weblog/index.htm#doerr">this comment</a> on <a HREF="http://www.siliconvalley.com/docs/news/depth/doerr071601.htm">John Doerr&#8217;s statement of regret</a> for an ill-advised comment during the inflation of the Internet bubble, <a HREF="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/07/17#danAndJohn">says I should let Doerr off the hook</a>. Sorry, I can&#8217;t do that.
</p>
<p>I think highly of Doerr in many ways. His record is certainly more positive than negative in the tech industry, and his support, through <a HREF="http://www.technet.org">TechNet</a>, of better education is valuable.
</p>
<p>But he is one of the people who fueled the Internet mania, and he is most definitely one of the people who profited the most from the bubble.
</p>
<p><a HREF="http://webseitz.editthispage.com/2001/07/17">Bill Seitz</a> has it right, I think, when he says Doerr and company (including the investment banks and &#8220;analysts&#8221;) realized they could make billions on small investors who were greedy and didn&#8217;t know any better. It was legal. It wasn&#8217;t right.
</p>
<p>Seitz says, &#8220;I also think that instead of relabelling the net as the greatest creation and evaporation of wealth, he should have honestly called it the greatest transfer of wealth (to him, his investors, the IBs, ad agencies, the founders of lame Silicon Alley consultancies, etc.).&#8221;
</p>
<p>This hits closer to home. I, too, profited from the bubble when technology journalism became so much more in demand. So did my company. (The company is currently taking quite a hit as a result of the plummeting advertising market in the wake of the bubble&#8217;s bursting.)
</p>
<p>John Doerr has done far more good than harm to the industry, and for society. The technology Kleiner Perkins helped nurture will be working to our mutual benefit for ages to come.
</p>
<p>But he and his cronies injected something dangerous into the mix during the height of the Internet hubris. They injected cynicism far greater than anything we&#8217;d seen prior to that time.
</p>
<p>John and others here in the valley were correctly appalled at the market distortions caused by the Microsoft monopoly. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re sufficiently bothered by the market distortions &#8212; and the corrosion of public trust in markets that resulted &#8212; they helped engineer.

				<p>AP: <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/docs/hottopics/msantitrust/029746.htm">Microsoft to ask appeals court for rehearing</a>. <i>Microsoft spokesman Viveck Varma said the petition was &#8220;a good-faith attempt to seek clarification,&#8221; and should not be read as an unwillingness to settle the landmark antitrust case out of court.</i></p>
<blockquote><p>Good faith? Microsoft doesn&#8217;t know the meaning of the expression.
<p>No, read this for what it is &#8212; a stalling tactic.
</p>
<p>Microsoft knows that the longer it can keep this case in court, the harder it will be for anyone to come up with meaningful remedies to its lawbreaking. Getting Windows XP onto PCs is the current priority.
</p>
<p>If the Justice Department and states don&#8217;t go for an injunction to block XP, at least the version that&#8217;s currently proposed for release, little they do in the future is likely to matter very much. Do they grasp that?<br />

<blockquote><i>Kirk&#8217;s mind raced as he quickly assessed his situation: the shields were down, the warp drive and impulse engines were dead, life support was failing fast, and the Enterprise was plummeting out of control toward the surface of Epsilon VI and, as Scotty and Spock searched frantically through the manuals trying to find a way to save them all, Kirk vowed, as he stared at the solid blue image filling the main view screen, that never again would he allow a Microsoft operating system to control his ship.</i></p></blockquote>
