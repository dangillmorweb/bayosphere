<li>Mercury News: <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/6434425.htm">Pac Bell Internet sues over subpoenas</a>. <i>Pacific Bell Internet Service said a cascade of subpoenas and 16,700 take-down notices from an electronic &#8220;bounty hunter&#8221; are turning it from an Internet service provider into the Internet police. The San Francisco-based unit of SBC Communications sued the recording industry, a New York software company and a San Francisco porn site in federal court Wednesday, saying it is being inundated with legal orders and can see no end in sight.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken my shots at SBC and its Pacific Bell subsidary, but this deserves compliments. The company is sticking up for its customers as well as its own business.</p>
<p>The music industry wants to turn ISPs in to copyright cops. The industry doesn&#8217;t want to go through the bother of persuading a judge that a user is a probable infringer &#8212; so it&#8217;s blanketing the nation&#8217;s courts with subpoenas based solely on one side&#8217;s allegations.</p>
<p>As an SBC lawyer told the Mercury News&#8217; Dawn Chmielewski, &#8220;These DMCA subpoena powers allow anyone to write a simple letter and obtain a subpoena by nothing more than the stamp from a clerk of court that can be used to ask for the private information of any Internet user.&#8221; This is unacceptable abuse of the system.</p>
<p>If the record companies have evidence &#8212; and they surely do in many cases &#8212; they should be compelled to show some of it first. Once again, a little balance would go a long way.

<p>I&#8217;m curious how this case will differ from the Verizon case? I haven&#8217;t seen that mentioned in any of the stories about this that I&#8217;ve read. It appears to be a difference of degree or volume, rather than of kind. So, how will the legal system get around the precedent of the Verizon case? Won&#8217;t we just end up with DMCA upheld, once again, and the Copyright Cartel still triumphant?</p>

<p>I have to agree with both Dan and Kim, but I lean more to Kim.</p>
<p>While the judges are more savvy in the San Ramon area than others, our legal system is very precedent-savvy, as well. Sure, the volume is higher &#8211; and that, along with the &#8220;show us the suspicions&#8221; &#8211; will probably be the crux of SBC&#8217;s issues.</p>
<p>But break the case down, request by request. Each one &#8211; alone &#8211; is upheld to some degree by the Verizon precedent. </p>
<p>Just a bunch of the same, instead of one.</p>
<p>My take: SBC is NOT doing this for their customers. NO. They are doing it for two reasons: 1) To save themselves the time and effort (both this time and in the future; if there was keystroke combo that would e-mail the request info to RIAA, they&#8217;d do it&#8230;), and 2) To protect themselves against future lawsuits. From both the customers (who will make some sort of privacy-invasion argument), AND the RIAA &#8212; hey, if RIAA is correct, and SBC customers are trading pirated files&#8230;well, SBC can be held for some sort of contributory infringment.</p>
<p>And who will the RIAA go after first? The 15-year-old who trades InSynch files, or &#8230; a multi-billion dollar company?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s a toughie&#8230;</p>
<p>Repeat after me: It&#8217;s all about the litigation (witness the SCO vs. IBM fiasco..)</p>

<p>My take? SBC probably got served out the wazoo and doesn&#8217;t want to do the work. We deal with them constantly as an ISP and they never fail to do the least work possible in their legal and billing departments.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Gillmor,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid you fundamentally misunsterstand the subpoena process in civil litigation.  In the federal courts, parties are empowered to issue subpoenas requiring others &#8212; both parties and non-parties &#8212; to hand over documents and appear for depositions, etc.  This has been the case since at least the early part of the 20th Century (possibly earlier &#8212; I am not a legal historian), but in any case well before anyone had conceived of the Internet or the DMCA.  The issuance of a subpoena does not require court approval; private parties issue them directly by themselves.  Subpoenas are ALWAYS &#8220;based solely on one side&#8217;s allegations.&#8221;  The recipient can, however, fight the subpoena in court.  Nearly every subpoena seeks information that the recipient considers &#8220;private&#8221; and wishes to keep that way &#8212; business records, personal information, etc.</p>
<p>The expedited subpoena provisions of the DMCA are really not a major change from the situation in pre-DMCA days.  Prior to the DMCA, the copyright owner could file suit against a &#8220;John Doe,&#8221; and then issue a subpoena to the ISP seeking the identity of the alleged infringer (with no court approval necessary for the subpoena).  The DMCA&#8217;s expedited subpoena provisions simply streamline the process, allowing the copyright owner to issue the subpoena directly, BEFORE filing suit.  But in neither case does a court have to look at a subpoena prior to its issuance to decide whether it is legitimate.  Your quarrel appears to be with the civil discovery process in general, not with the DMCA in particular.</p>
<p>One last point:  You say that SBC may get a different result in federal court in California because &#8220;Judges around here are savvier about technology.&#8221;  This is not fair.  First, many federal judges in the DC Circuit are savvy about technology.  But, more importantly, I think you misunderstand the role of judges in such a case.  The vast majority of judges decide cases by asking, &#8220;What does the statute require?&#8221;  They do not &#8212; as you imply they should &#8212; ask, &#8220;Do I think it&#8217;s a good statute?  And, if not, how should I write an opinion in accord with how I would have preferred the statute was written.&#8221;  Like it or not (obviously you don&#8217;t), the DMCA authorizes the type of subpoenas that the RIAA has been issuing.  But it&#8217;s the fault of Congress, not of the judges who are under an obligation to interpret the law faithfully as it was written &#8212; not as they might prefer it to be.</p>

<p>The media operation that helped create the 1990s stock bubble hasn&#8217;t learned much from the experience. As the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/28/business/media/28BART.html">reports: </a><br />
<blockquote><i>&#8220;Maria Bartiromo, the stock-market reporter and anchorwoman for CNBC, opened her hourlong television interview earlier this month with Sanford I. Weill, the chief executive of Citigroup, with an unusual disclosure. She told viewers that she owned 1,000 shares of Citigroup stock, then worth about $45,000.</p>
<p>Neither Ms. Bartiromo nor her supervisors thought her stake in Citigroup should disqualify her from questioning Mr. Weill about the company&#8217;s future and his decision to step down as chief executive at year-end. Amy Zelvin, a spokeswoman for CNBC, said Ms. Bartiromo had abided by the network&#8217;s policies, which Ms. Zelvin said were intended to ensure &#8216;compliance with the highest ethical standards.'&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Imagine how CNBC would behave with lower ethical standards.

<p>It&#8217;s been traditional, or at least it was traditional before the Internet Bubble, that journalists who reported on companies for financial news, as well as many &#8220;analysts&#8221; who published newsletters on companies for the same market, did not own stocks, at least in the companies on which they reported.</p>
<p>The growth of 401K and other mutual fund types of investments have made these borders blurry. Add the perhaps desirable characteristic of a fellow market gambler preaching to other&#8217;s with the problem and these ethical bounderies are no longer perceived as needed.</p>
<p>Since journalists frequently report on subjects about which they no nothing, or next to nothing, perhaps it&#8217;s been seen as better that they have some stake in the financial markets when writing about them in public?</p>

<p>&#8220;Imagine how CNBC would behave with lower ethical standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s easy: she wouldn&#8217;t have disclosed it. And then we would never have known about it, and they wouldn&#8217;t be geeting this press.</p>
<p>For me, the self-disclosure helps mitigate the issue. But yes, it would have been better if CNBC had found someone else to conduct the interview.</p>

<p>Jim, of course she&#8217;s allowed to own stocks, but she shouldn&#8217;t be in the position of questioning the CEO of a company that a significant fraction of her own net worth is invested in.  A different reporter should be chosen to do that interview.</p>

<p>The nytimes article omits a key piece of information: did she allow her stock ownership to influence the interview? That&#8217;s the data point one needs in order to decide if there is a problem. By all accounts she conducted a tough interview, asking the questions that Weill would have preferred not been asked.</p>
<p>I can see why someone would get upset if she had done a puff piece; then her stock ownership would mean something. But she disclosed it, and she didn&#8217;t let her ownership compromise the interview.</p>
<p>Frankly, given the nytimes&#8217; credibility problems, I&#8217;m surprised that anyone would take this article seriously. It illustrates one of the many problems with journalism today (in this case not giving the reader a key piece of information). And I&#8217;m disappointed that Dan would unthinkingly swallow junk like this from any source.</p>

<p>The very best story on the topic of CNBC and the bubble was titled &#8220;Rah-rah CNBC had the suckers going for a ride&#8221;<br />It was in the San Francisco Examiner (some time ago), written by Martha Smilgis</p>
<p>You can see the entire piece:  <br /><a href="http://www.examiner.com/business/default.jsp?story=b.investor.0315">http://www.examiner.com/business/default.jsp?story=b.investor.0315</a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an excerpt: </p>
<p>THERE IS NO doubt in my mind that we fools who have religiously watched CBNC over the past three years have lost money in the stock market.  My proof comes from the network&#8217;s ratings. When the Nasdaq zoomed to astronomical highs, CNBC&#8217;s viewership soared as well. Now, with the Nasdaq in free-fall, we remorseful investors click off the tube. The network of promise has become the network of pain.</p>
<p>History, however, teaches us to behave differently. The more scholarly sages of Wall Street tell us that the 6 percent of investors who buy at the bottom of the market make money and the 80 percent of us who fell for the CNBC daily drumbeat of casino hype &#8212; and bought tech stocks near the top &#8212;- are, simply put, suckers. We suckers are now turning away from what was our favorite feel-good network, disgusted at the sinking value of our once-beloved stocks.</p>

<p>The Big Lie in this budget is that there&#8217;s no tax increase. The legislators would borrow more billions instead, and now they get to pretend that there&#8217;s no consequence.</p>
<p>What a crock. How will we pay back those loans (plus the exhorbitant interest California now must pay due to the state&#8217;s fiscal mess)? Why, with our tax dollars.</p>
<p>So, in a few years, barring an economic miracle that only a fool would rely on, the situation will be this: California will either just about eliminate &#8212; not just cut back &#8212; popular and/or vital services, or it will have higher taxes.</p>
<p>The phoniness of this budget &#8220;compromise&#8221; is nauseating. But maybe we Californians get the government we deserve. We&#8217;re definitely getting the one we voted for.

<p>Yeah, we are paying a finance charge.  Yeah, we are paying more for the money than other States.  The solution sucks, but the economy sucks more.</p>
<p>It may be better to take the loan and amortize State revenue across multiple years until our economy and tax base improves, rather than immediately slicing a pound of flesh out of our taxpayers in 2004 while we&#8217;re down and out.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t live in Silicon Valley and be a total pessimist. The nature of the place is optimistic.</p>
<p>But I sense that people are failing to remember that history does teach us things. And I&#8217;m astonished at our collectively scant attention span.</p>

<p>to add to the gist of your column: UC and state-school tuition just went up by 30% [1]! Which has sparked a law student-led, multi-million dollar class-action lawsuit [2] against the Regents.</p>

<p>The NY Times has a good article today on the affect of the budget crises in many states on the national economy:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/28/business/28ECON.html?hp">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/28/business/28ECON.html?hp</a></p>
<p>One scary thing is that the States are relying on optimistic growth rates on the future to try to limit cuts now.  This piper will have to be paid eventually if the economy doesn&#8217;t speed up.</p>

<p>As a &#8220;professional&#8221; student at UC Berkeley, I found great amusement in the class-action suit. I also found it quite interesting that the first place I heard about the suit was not from the school, or from my peers, but from Dan Gillmor&#8217;s blog.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the implications of the tuition hike will likely be quite severe. Some students will not return in the fall, and the price of education for our out-of-state colleagues is very unattractive.</p>

<p>When I have seen a bubble economy in Tokyo fifteen years ago, I was not sure what is going on.  I could not believe how people behave on the great economy.  I could not really believe this would continue.  In 1992 the bubble bursted.  Even after the burst, Japan kept ignoring simple and logical rules of economy.  The economy is still in a major deflation a decade later.</p>
<p>I moved to Silicon Valley in 1992.  The economy was not exactly in a good status yet.  As you know, it went into a major growth stage.  However, in 1998 the level of growth was way more than reality.  I had to say &#8220;Uh-oh, here we go again&#8221; just like you.  Obviously US did not really learn from the other part of the world.  Unfortunately this &#8220;uh-oh&#8221; won&#8217;t be the last one.  I guarantee it.  I can see many of those in our world history.  It is not like no one told you&#8230;</p>

<p>The negligence of Verisign has been so outrageous in this matter that it would have been a surprise for the court to hold any other way.</p>
<p>Of course, the company now requires customers to formally agree that Verisign is not responsible for negligence, among other outrageous terms of service. What registrars behave better? Post a comment with your recommendations.

<p>You can&#8217;t make up stuff this bizarre. The New York Post <a href="http://www.nypost.com/business/1461.htm">reports</a> that Esquire has &#8220;commissioned (Jayson) Blair to write about Stephen Glass. I guess the Esquire editors attended the class in social satire but missed the one on professional shame.

<p>After all the terror alerts die down, this would be a great way to privatize those facilities in Guantanamo Bay.</p>
<p>By the RIAA calculations, could easily be paid by the huge increase in CD sales resulting from this.</p>

<p>How many people have died in the past year because of file sharing ?  How many due to speeding ? Which is going to attract the most draconian penalties ?  Just how much &#8216;damage&#8217; is a single shared file to an artist, (not how much is it to the RIAA)?  How much compensation does the government allow for the loss of a small toe?</p>
<p>If we are to believe the RIAA the sharing of a single file is the equivalent in terms of bodily injury compensation of both arms and probably both legs too. Is this absurd? Greed knows no bounds.</p>
<p>And by the way&#8230; just how are the RIAA going to prove that any one person allowed the upload of any more than a fragment of a song ?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in Iowa, one of my favorite places, for the <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com/index.php">Gnomedex 3.0</a>, a tech conference started by <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/">Chris Pirillo</a>. I&#8217;m on the program tomorrow afternoon (the schedule in today&#8217;s local newspaper didn&#8217;t include my talk).</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time in Iowa in the mid- to late-1980s, when I worked for the <a href="http://www.kcstar.com">Kansas City Times</a> (now part of the KC Star). The job included regional politics, so I found myself almost living in Iowa as the state&#8217;s famous presidential caucuses drew huge numbers of candidates and supporters. In particular, I followed Dick Gephardt, the Missouri congressman who first ran for president in 1988.</p>
<p>I also came to Iowa on many other stories including the &#8217;80s farm financial crisis (and the turmoil in much of rural America in those years). For a time I chased some radical right-wing nutballs around the Farm Belt; they got more traction in Nebraska and other states than they did in Iowa, which I attribute to Iowans&#8217; good sense and civic responsibility.

<p>Dan, any chance we could get a copy of your presentation from Gnomedex?</p>

<p>Thanks for a great talk. I&#8217;m really glad that you came to the conference and that Chris was able to squeeze you into the program. It&#8217;s nice when a lecture makes you think. You gave us plenty of food for thought. Glad you like Iowa, I grew up here and, even though I&#8217;ve lived in California and Texas, which I enjoyed, I still came back here and am happier than I ever was in either place. It&#8217;s nice that a journalist from the west coast &#8220;gets&#8221; Iowa. Thanks again.</p>

<p>The presentation is a mega-file. I&#8217;ll convert it to a web presentation and post it, probably on the &#8220;Making the News&#8221; site that we&#8217;re creating for the book. When it&#8217;s up I&#8217;ll put a note in the blog.</p>

<p>Well Dan, I&#8217;m a republican from Iowa, and you are no Iowan.</p>
