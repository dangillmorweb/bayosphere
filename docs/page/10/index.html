<p>I&#8217;d say blogging holds important advantages for citizen reporters, among them, real-time control over publication, updates, and followups.</p>
<p>At the same time, the OhMyNews approach seems to impose fewer barriers to earning a spot on the front page everyone&#8217;s reading for many reporters.</p>
<p>An approach combining the best of the two might involve a popular site republishing what&#8217;s blogged.  The next generation of my site will hopefully attempt to do this in a mostly automated fashion.  But a human-edited approach may even be more successful.</p>

				<p>My older, wiser brother Steve <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/index.php?p=203">reports</a> that <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a>&#8216;s Dave Sifry will be a talking head on CNN&#8217;s convention coverage. He says: &#8220;Just as CNN continues to provide the gavel&#8211;to-gavel coverage the networks used to do, its alliance with Technorati validates the voice and authority of the blogosphere. In effect, CNN becomes the first bridge between the broadcast age and the peer-to-peer age of the real-time network.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t go that far, given that CNN is the network that told a staffer who had a <a href="http://www.kevinsites.net/">blog</a> to stop, but it&#8217;s definitely a sign of progress.</p>

<p>A interesting side effect of the competition between Google and Yahoo for web email is that as well as increasing the file storage, they&#8217;ve also upped the maximum attachment size to 10Mb.  That means songs can be emailed.</p>
<p>Something like MusicBrainz can list all the tracks and map each one to one or more GMail accounts.  As this is just a list it would be hard for the RIAA to get a discovery notice served on it.</p>
<p>This is just an idea, you understand&#8230;</p>

<p>Ever since Yahoo increased their mail storage to 100MB, it doesn&#8217;t work right anymore. They just did&#8217;t think this one out and plan for it.<br />Plus, why won&#8217;t they do like MS did with Hotmail last year and let report and block entire domains as spam. I rarely get spam at my Hotmail address anymore, way down from the 40-75 a day I used to get.<br />Yahoo is a whole &#8216;nother story.<br />I get around 100 spams a day a the Yahoo address. Sure they go to the bulk mail folder, but I have to go thru that folder, because the Idiots at Yahoo won&#8217;t add a button for &#8220;This Is A Newletter I Subscribe To&#8221; or something like that. And I already have used up all my available filters for other mail sorting.</p>

<p>On another topic, I saw the documentary &#8220;Outfoxed&#8221;.   Very well done.  Interviews with former and present Fox News employees and contributors.  Internal Fox memos.  They use hundreds of clips from Fox News analysis and reporting to show how the news is blatantly distorted.  The movie was done in secret and released on DVD first in case Fox tried to stop them. <br /><a href="http://www.outfoxed.org/">http://www.outfoxed.org/</a> </p>

<p>Owen, Dan Gillmor only bans conservatives who post reasonable, but embarrassing, comments about *him*.</p>
<p>Not even chastising Bill Clinton qualifies, it seems.</p>
<p>Of course, Owen, it&#8217;s fair to ask, can you cite a *single* positive outcome of Clinton&#8217;s &#8220;don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; policy, or even explain clearly what it attempted to accomplish?</p>
<p>By the way, you should look up the comments of various conservative Members of Congress following Clinton&#8217;s comments in the first 10 days of his Administration, about eliminating the ban on gays in the military.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find warnings about an explosion of perverse acts in the military &#8212; even an explicit mention of the possibility of acts of perversion being committed against foreign nationals in U.S. military custody. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m giving up on my paid Yahoo mail account. Many times I get a message &#8220;Temporary problem, try again later&#8221; or &#8220;contact us if the problem reoccurs&#8221;. I have contacted them 35 times and get the same dumb canned message that they have checked and all is ok. Now I am not getting some messages sent to my Yahoo address or they arrive several hours after being sent. Bottom line, their email service is poor and they don&#8217;t give a damn. </p>

<p>Jonathan, I looked at Osama&#8217;s site, and you&#8217;d have to be named Osama to buy those alleged facts. It looks like someone&#8217;s telling lies out of school. To work, the thing would have to be too large a conspiracy.</p>
<p>Besides, the alleged purpose, &#8220;the rape of Iraqi boys for the purpose of blackmailing their parents,&#8221;  does not make sense. Wouldn&#8217;t it be the opposite: to blackmail the perps themselves. That makes sense, for they are the criminals caught on tape. But if someone comes to you with a videotape of him abusing your child and says he is going to show it if you don&#8217;t give him information, well, isn&#8217;t the answer to tell him to show it and be damned.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think any such thing ever happened. Let&#8217;s discuss reality.</p>

<p>The perfect place to ask if, according to federal sentencing guidelines as a penalty for lying to an officer of the court&#8230; Martha Stewart should have been spared five months jail time, and received instead the same slap on the wrist as Bill Clinton did?</p>

<p>Wow!</p>
<p>We get rid of one troll, and they reprodu<br />
ce (apparently asexually) all over an open thread.</p>
<p>Alright children, please pay attention.  I have personal friends who served, in various branches of the United States Military Services, Honorably (according to their discharge papers from DOD) before, during, in, and after VietNam:</p>
<p>1)  Infantry.<br />2)  Nuclear Submarines.<br />3)  Air Force.<br />4)  While there are others who come to mind, I believe this is a broad enough representative sample.</p>
<p>If your pejorative comments are taken at face value, one must accept that Bill Clinton controlled the Pentagon in the 1950&#8217;s, 1960&#8217;s and 1970&#8217;s.  I suspect that you will agree with me that such a belief is somewhat of a stretch.</p>
<p>Each of these Veterans (several decorated) is homosexual.  Each of these Veterans Honorably served in the United States Military Forces to defend your freedom to dislike them.</p>
<p>So, as the mature, respectful and gentle adults that you are, please thank them for their service to our Country and their service to you (BTW, there is no need for that snide remark that just flashed across your brain).</p>

<p>Gays in military:  The most well known Abu Ghraib prison abusers, Lindy England and her boyfriend that were in so many of those pictures were quite definitely heterosexual.  Surprisingly, sexual abuse has  very little to do with sex and much to do with power and domination.  Even more strange, in some cultures, the sexually abused are a embarrassment to the family and not considered victims.  Iraq is one of such places.  Women won&#8217;t report rape because they are afraid of the family&#8217;s backlash.</p>

<p>Anyone using SBC as their ISP or to host their domain would be wise to keep an eye on their email.  On July 4th, SBC implemented an ISP based spam filtering. I had been scratching my head wondering the last few days why I suddenly wasn&#8217;t getting some regular email newsletters.  After a few days of back and forth and testing, I called SBC and discovered that they had implemented this new spam filter &#8220;feature&#8221; WITHOUT NOTIFYING ANYONE.  Similarly, back in June, they suddenly implemented rDNS checking without notification, which led to a lot of people not getting their mail and a number of newspaper stories.  Finally, they were forced to remove this new functionality a few weeks later. </p>
<p>With the spam filters, they claim to be still &#8220;tweaking&#8221; them.  What I can&#8217;t understand is why they are doing their &#8220;tweaking&#8221; with live user mail in real time.  I tried to send them a copy of a good mail that they should not be rejecting but I couldn&#8217;t even get it to tech support.  It got rejected at the email server!  So how do they &#8220;tweak&#8221; filters without user feedback on what is or is not spam?</p>
<p>SBC does not present a notification to the user than any mail was blocked as spam.  There are no user controls in their software, no way to opt-out, no way to exclude an account, no &#8220;spam bucket&#8221; to retrieve rejected mail from!  All they do is a simple bounce-back to whomever sent the mail with this &#8220;illuminating&#8221; error:</p>
<p>**************************************<br />   SMTP error from remote mailer after end of data:<br />    host mail-fwd.mx.sbc-webhosting.com [161.58.18.5]:<br />    554 Denied <br />**************************************</p>
<p>Pretty damm useless, right?  Most distributors who get a message like this just delete the user.  They aren&#8217;t going to run around and try and notify people that mail to them got rejected.  So it may be weeks or months before a user realizes that he hasn&#8217;t gotten some newsletter he subscribed to.  Then he has to try and chase down what is going on. Fortunately for me, I use a mail forwarding service for all my newsletters and subscriptions, so I was able to change the forward-to address from my pop3 address on SBC to a webmail account.  However, I can&#8217;t easily save those newsletters in the folders I have set up in my pop3 Outlook mailbox.</p>
<p>I requested that SBC turn off their spam filtering UNTIL they have a user interface in place to allow people to &#8220;opt-out&#8221; of this feature or to control it better.  They flat-out told me that is not going to happen.  I finally got a supervisor to tell me that they expected to have some sort of user interface in 2-3 weeks (MAYBE).  So I called the PUC in California today.  They told me they couldn&#8217;t do anything but forwarded me to SBC Executive Complaints office, where I was told that they have been getting other complaints on this also.  I filed a formal complaint with them.  The Executive Office telephone number is:  800.403.3302</p>
<p>Just like the U.S. Post Office, I believe than an ISP has a contractual requirement to deliver all mail addressed to the user, UNLESS the user has explicitly given his permission to the ISP to pre-screen his mail.  IMO, it is the users responsibility to protect themselves from spam mail, not the ISP&#8217;s.  Wonder if some lawyer is interested in starting a class-action suit against SBC on this issue?  </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a story I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised gets buried in the American media. According to the Australian paper Sunday Morning Herald, Iyad Allawi&#8211;Bush&#8217;s hand-picked man to run Iraq the interim&#8211;personally engaged in a summary execution of up to six suspected insurgents a few days before he took over. The witnesses (there are more than one) don&#8217;t appear to be just angry anti-Allawi types downing an American puppet, in fact they were quite pleased by the action. </p>

<p>Jonathon, I wasn&#8217;t defending the hypocritical Clinton policy, just astonished at the suggestion that the policy was responsible for gays in the military.  There have been gays fighting for their country as long as there have been armies and nations. Being gay has nothing to do with courage or patriotism, any more than (as Ted points out) sexual abuse is a gay predeliction. The same prejudices used to prevent blacks and women from fighting for their country. </p>
<p>To me the reaction of conservatives blaming gays for sodomized prisoners is akin to the same people them being blamed for the decline of marriage&#8230;ignorant and bigoted.</p>

<p>The conservative comments contemporaneous with Clinton&#8217;s &#8220;don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t tell&#8221;, spoke of liberalizing the treatment of gays in the military as leading to a complete breakdown of discipline with regard to sexual misconduct of *all* types, including heterosexual.</p>
<p>When they spoke of Clinton policy leading potentially to the sexual mistreatement of foreign nationals in military custody, it was *not* a suggestion that a few flaming gay troops would commit sodomy on prisoners.  It was about a breakdown of discipline regarding sexual misconduct.</p>
<p>Their comments were prescient, to say the least.</p>

<p>Hey Jonathan, are you sure the breakdown in discipline wasn&#8217;t due to allowing women in the military, or was it allowing non-citizens, or blacks, or southerners, or irish, or italians?</p>

<p>Hey, Peter, maybe Jonathon&#8217;s onto something.  When I was in the Army, there were lots of undesirables who we could eliminate&#8230;no women, it was before women officially drew combat duty, but lots of spics, micks, wops, gooks, kikes, niggers, and liberal-college-long-hair-commie-pinko-fags (it&#8217;s always hypenated).  Maybe we should have thrown them all out, and no doubt the ones left over would thrown themselves enthusiastically into the fray.  Sure would have made a lot of guys happy to get out of Vietnam in one piece. Boy, talk about a small army left.</p>
<p>Oops, that&#8217;s right&#8230;only the poor ones went&#8230;their betters got deferrals or slipped into the Guard lists.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Jonathon&#8217;s concerns about maintaining the high moral condition of our armed forces have some awkward realities.  Most of the abuses have been coming at the hands of good ol&#8217; heterosexuals and imposed on women and gays (and prisoners) not the other way &#8217;round.  </p>
<p>As to the impact on morale&#8230;only the rear-area types were concerned about it when we were fighting in the bush.  The gays I know laughed at our adolescent fears that they all had the hots to see us in the shower.  In combat, we were concerned about a man&#8217;s courage and reliability and skill in the face of fire&#8230;not what he did in town on pass.  I never heard of a gay man propositioning an unwilling straight man&#8230;it probably happened, but it was not common, anymore than the incidents of rape and irresponsible sexual conduct by GI&#8217;s were characteristic of the rest of us.</p>
<p>So lighten up.  Don&#8217;t let your prejudices force you to judge men by one characteristic, but by the totality of their behavior and character.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve had a flood of suggestions from you good folks about my troll problem.Some are, at the moment, technically not feasible. Others are a good possibility, and I&#8217;m forwarding them along to our tech folks.</p>
<p>Some of you have said you won&#8217;t miss the comments if they disappear entirely. But I still believe the conversation is important, for all of us, when it works right, and I do want to bring it back.</p>
<p>Incidentally, several of the people who wrote with suggestions are among my more fierce critics on this page. They still think I&#8217;m mistaken on the issues (we agree to disagree). They aren&#8217;t here to cause trouble, but to truly discuss the issues, and they hope we can restore that discussion for those of us who aren&#8217;t here just to play troll games. </p>
<p>I hope so, too, and while I&#8217;m thanking everyone individually who wrote, here&#8217;s my public appreciation for the ideas and, most of all, good will.</p>

<p>I, for one, hope you keep the comment sections open. With this big push into participatory journalism, well, it isn&#8217;t really participatory if comments are disabled. It&#8217;s my biggest point of disappointment for the Denton properties (Gawker, Defamer, Gizmodo, etc), which are great reads but have topics I want to comment on once in a while.</p>
<p>If I just want to read columns, I can read some of the other blogs out there that have no comment abilities, and then feel like I&#8217;m being lectured to. </p>
<p>Keep up the good fight, Dan.</p>

<p>Moderate, don&#8217;t censor.</p>
<p>For example, Slashdot doesn&#8217;t delete stuff that&#8217;s obviously junk.  It just  gets moderated down (typically below everyone&#8217;s theshold).  </p>

<p>The problem with moderation in the style of Slashdot is that most of the time it doesn&#8217;t work (sorry if that seems blunt, but it really doesn&#8217;t). Making the moderation distributed among contributors necessarily results in a perpetuation of &#8220;groupthink&#8221;.</p>
<p>However much the moderation guidelines state that moderation should be based on the quality and relevance of the content and not whether you, the moderator, personally agree with it, that&#8217;s not how it really works. Perfectly well written but unpopular views are habitually moderated down, but popular dreck rises to the top.</p>

<p>I cant understand what all the fuss is about. Let the trolls post, and let everyone else ignore them.  </p>
<p>I never saw anything offensive or objectionable in Als rants.  But I have to admit that I got to the point where I probably only read 5-10% of them.  I went back and looked at a few of his more recent posts after he was black listed.  Some of them were obviously unsubstantiated theories and opinions, but then again so are many of Dans posts. </p>

<p>Said it before in this space and I will say it again.  Why is it that liberals are all for free speech &#8211; unless it&#8217;s free speech for a conservative.</p>
<p>Others who post here regularly go much further over the line between fact and fiction than any post I have ever seen from good old Al.</p>

<p>I tend to agree with earlier posters on the most appropriate solution: do nothing and stop worrying about it.</p>
<p>If trolls choose to post, just ignore them. If people post unsubstantiable &#8220;facts&#8221; and cannot respond when challenged, it&#8217;s quite obvious what happened.</p>
<p>Free speech is ugly sometimes, because some of the most enthusiastic (or loudest) participants can be arrogant and unscrupulous. But that&#8217;s what free speech looks like&#8230;</p>

<p>What about a community-based moderating system?  This &#8220;Whack-A-Troll&#8221; technology would allow us readers to &#8220;rate&#8221; a comment on a sliding &#8220;usefulness / relevance&#8221; scale.  The end user can filter comments so that only those rated say from 3-5 stars/hearts/flowers show up in their entirety, displaying only the titles/subjects of the posts outside of their preferred threshold (which of course can be clicked on and viewed).  A reader can vote only once on how to moderate a comment &#8211; special designations such as &#8220;off-topic, but interesting&#8221; could also be included in order to encourage the natural flow of conversation.  Of course, this wouldn&#8217;t be a completely fool-proof system &#8211; none of them are.</p>

<p>The &#8220;sticks and stones&#8221; response seems most appropriate for most of the jerks who stop in, but then again most of the really bad stuff was directed very personally at our host, and we don&#8217;t know what kind of really objectionable content may have been excised.</p>
<p>I think the point Dan&#8217;s been trying to make is that when personally abusive speech, false accusations and misrepresentations escalate to a certain point, the hospitality of the house can&#8217;t reasonably be extended to the guest any longer.  That&#8217;s understandable, and it&#8217;s unfortunate that some people aren&#8217;t housebroken.</p>
<p>Rick, I know it&#8217;s a matter of perception, but I&#8217;ve not noticed a greater permissiveness towards some of the visitors from the far left&#8230;a troll is a troll, and many middle-of-the-roader correspondents inthis blog have been uniformly critical of trolls of all colors.  Al&#8217;z has simply been much more offensive than anybody else.</p>
<p>BTW, it&#8217;s probably worthwhile to review the terms of participation at the bottom of the page&#8230;Dan&#8217;s simply doing what he said he would do under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Assuming we&#8217;re dealing with trollery, not spoofing:</p>
<p>When Olmsted created Central Park in NYC, I understand he didn&#8217;t have paths put in until later&#8230; where people walked. I believe it would be technically feasible to set up a system where the first people who stroll through comments would be able to tick a &#8220;Trollery&#8221; button.</p>
<p>On hitting submit, the color of the table cell containing the &#8220;Trollery&#8221; tick would grow one shade darker. That way, future viewers could skim over, or ignore, the ever-darkening boxes. You might even allow passers-by to lighten an entry with a tick if they thought it had redeeming social value.</p>
<p>That way the Blogger wouldn&#8217;t have to waste time moderating. Readers would judge.</p>

<p>Rick,</p>
<p>I feel that Dan has been crystal clear on this point.  He does not object to people who hold different views then him, but he does have a problem with people that impersonate others, and deliberately mischaracterize his views and actions.  Any argument otherwise is not supported by facts (witness plenty of conservative posters other than the trolls), and futile imho.  If Dan really did not want conservative posts, why wouldn&#8217;t he just simply delete them?  It&#8217;d be a heck of a lot easier than trying to rebut all the trolls.</p>

<p>I like the color-coding idea, way more elegant than numeric scores.  But the problem with reader moderation is that it is trivially swamped with scripting or by invoking the masses from a similarly minded (to the troll) board.  </p>
<p>There has to be some threshold of trust that moderators must acquire.  Slashdot does it by requiring moderators to have been positively moderated a certain number of times.  Smaller sites can do it via the board owner simply selecting a few people he/she has come to trust.  Maybe Dan can detail an intern to moderate?  Does the news biz still have interns?</p>

<p>Rick, I&#8217;ve been more than tolerant of all shades of speech here. I haven&#8217;t complained about the most virulent disagreements with what I&#8217;ve said, except when they&#8217;ve been accompanied by outright lies about me. I&#8217;ve let people insult me in ways that are deeply offensive. In general, this was supposed to be an open place for all.</p>
<p>Many people asked me to ban you-know-who long before now for the offensive way he/she was using the forum. I declined repeatedly, on the principle that even someone as disruptive and basically mean as this person should have an opportunity to speak. I and most people came to dismiss what  he/she was doing, in part because it was being done in such a laughably crude style that more than once made me wonder if some left-wing disinformation specialist might be trying to poison the well by posting such bizarre right-wing cant. People were also offended by the poster&#8217;s cowardly manner: anonymous, vitriolic sniping from the bushes.  I was especially reluctant to ask him/her to leave, too, because, deep down in the crud, there were elements of intelligence and worthwhile topics of dispute, and an occasional fair point.</p>
<p>I drew a line when the postings turned into repeated statements that were false and probably defamatory about me and my employer &#8212; reposted after my explaining that they were false. If you have a weblog with comments I&#8217;ll bet you don&#8217;t tolerate that, either.</p>

As for Peter&#8217;s comment &#8211; you are apparently not color-blind, just how is color-coding &#8220;way more elegant?&#8221;  and what does this mean &#8220;trivially swamped with scripting&#8221; &#8211; Is it too much to ask the end-user to select a radio-button?  </p>
<p>As far as setting the moderator&#8217;s credibility &#8211; leave this to the end user &#8211; their preferences could be set to ignore votes cast by certain people.</p>

<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but what seemed to push you over the line was Al/Mc&#8217;s interesting argument that your paycheck from Knight Ridder for promoting liberal, anti-Bush points of view should be treated like any other ##soft-money corporate campaign donation##, as your opinions so often mimic those of the DNC and the Kerry campaign, you are paid by corporate money, and corporate money funds distribution of your newspaper and the maintenance of this web site.</p>
<p>Is it not a stretch to call such an argument &#8220;defamation&#8221;?  That is a serious charge, and you shouldn&#8217;t make it so lightly.</p>
<p>And no, I am not Al/Mc.  Just a reader who values him for pressuring you to be more honest about your prejudices and ideology.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is it that liberals are all for free speech &#8211; unless it&#8217;s free speech for a conservative.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a private forum, the operator gets to choose what speech is allowed. In a public forum over which the government has control, limited methods may be used to censor speech. If you try to walk into R.J. Reynolds headquarters and start engaging anyone who passes in anti-smoking rhetoric &#8211; however politeyly &#8211; you will be ejected, probably arrested, probably convicted of trespassing.</p>
<p>If you do the same thing in a public space, like a park, a city street, etc., government has tried to constrain this speech, but often loses. The &#8220;free speech&#8221; zones, which are an affront to civil disagreement, are opposed by both conservatives and liberals, but often not by Republicans (or Democrats, for that matter, if it serves their purpose).</p>
<p>Speech in this forum has guidelines. Speech on the Internet has few. If you hate the guidelines in this forum and have your remarks deleted, it&#8217;s not censorship. It&#8217;s the exercise of control over private property, a cherished principle held by conservatives back to the founding of this nation. Ask Will Buckley about that one and he&#8217;ll talk your ear off.</p>
<p>However, because the Internet has few limits on speech, technical or legal, there&#8217;s nothing to stop you from forming your own forum in which there are no rules or in which you post only things that would offensive in this forum. Or that follow your own rules.</p>
<p>The trope about liberals-this and liberals-that doesn&#8217;t hold up. Dan is behaving entirely like a conservative here, actually, and I support it.</p>

<p>Changing the concept a bit, I like the idea of the text getting fainter and fainter as more folks moderate a post as &#8220;troll&#8221; or &#8220;abusive&#8221;, until it fades out completely leaving just plain white space.  </p>
<p>On open reader moderation, anyone as obsessed as Al&#8217;s and his mutants could write scripts to swamp a reader moderation system with 100s or 1000s of &#8220;votes&#8221;, overriding the single moderations performed by individual readers.  Yes, there are ways to detect scripting, but there are also ways to hide it or make stopping it exclude legitimate readers.  That&#8217;s why I say it comes down to a moderator having to achieve a level of trust before being allowed to influence others&#8217; posts.</p>
<p>Maybe require a time period between first posting and access to moderation?  A 3 month delay would discourage most moderation-hackers, especially if their moderation access was terminated immediately after abuse.</p>

<p>The question of this thread is something different:  whether Dan will ridiculously hide under a rock from comments he finds uncomfortable, distasteful or unacceptably revealing.</p>

<p>Throw me a bone and point out an example of outright dishonesty on Dan&#8217;s part. Something obviously rubbed you the wrong way and it would be nice of you to share it with the rest of the class.</p>
<p>The troll was getting libelous. Dan&#8217;s reputation is his livelyhood. THAT is serious stuff. BTW, how can one libel an anonymous troll? How was poor Al&#8217;s really defamed?</p>

<p>When the offending people keep changing their ids, the &#8220;ignore individual&#8221; options gets less effective.  For example, look at the Marsh McLennan stock board at (warning, profanity in some userids) <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/mb?s=MMC">http://finance.yahoo.com/q/mb?s=MMC</a> .  The chuck/shemp and other socket puppet users&#8217; job is to fill the board with noise immediately after anything  informative is posted, making sure the useful post is pushed off the first page.  They keep changing their ids, and yahoo limits you to about 10 ignores.</p>

<p>I agree that this is Dan&#8217;s play house, and he gets to control the door.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s an interesting, and applicable, quote of an interesting, and applicable, quote (credits at the link):</p>
<p> &#8220;Rather than shying away from controversy we should be running toward it! That is the lesson of online and of the era of opinionated news: We live for controversy. We should welcome it precisely because we&#8217;re smart enough to watch any opinion and decide for ourselves what we think; we don&#8217;t need Big Brother or Big Mother deciding what we should and shouldn&#8217;t hear or see or read.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t know why I have to keep saying this, but one more time: I welcome controversial, opinionated discussions, especially with people who disagree with my own views. There&#8217;s a pretty think line between that and what our troll was doing. </p>
<p>I am tempted to say at this point that people who continue to claim that my motive has been to shut down conservative opinion on ideological grounds are themselves trolls. They don&#8217;t seem willing to take yes for an answer.</p>
<p>This thread is so familiar, isn&#8217;t it? Most of you are discussing the matter in a civil way, even though there are disagreements. But a couple of people here are resorting to the kind of behavior (albeit in a much less offensive manner) that caused me to shut down comments on other threads, at least for the time being.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re looking into technical solutions, but trolls are determined to disrupt whatever they encounter.</p>
<p>Anyway, let&#8217;s keep talking here.</p>

<p>Each comment gets 3 radio buttons and 3 attached counters: (1)I agree, (2)Disagree, (3)Think you&#8217;re a troll</p>
<p>When the troll count exceeds a threshold set by Dan, the comment gets moved to a troll&#8217;s corner. It is not censored. Anyone who wants to look at troll comments can still do so. They merely have to click into the trolls&#8217; corner. This will be a form of democratic, public rebuke without censorship via what is known as the tyranny of the majority. Freedom of speech is respected and freedom from trolls is also respected.</p>
<p>What do you think?<br />(1) Good idea<br />(2) Dumb idea<br />(3) Go away, you&#8217;re another troll</p>

<p>Scott, one of the problems with trolls like Al&#8217;s/whatever was that HE &#8220;hide[s] under a rock from comments he finds uncomfortable, distasteful or unacceptably revealing&#8221;.  He didn&#8217;t show himself to be as capable of defending his ideas as you credit him; on the contrary, when questioned about his statements or asked for elaboration (as Dan often did, and as Paul repeatedly asked you), he resorted to abusive responses, shrill accusations, hypocritical evasions and offensively smug putdowns &#8212; and wouldn&#8217;t address the substance of issues. </p>
<p>Personally I thought of him as an Al Franken without a sense of humor.  I don&#8217;t consider that kind of verbal pissing to be adding value either, and I&#8217;m pretty tolerant of people&#8217;s ideas.  Al&#8217;s and Al are the worst enemies of their ideas, for the same reason. </p>

<p>In what way aren&#8217;t Republicans welcome?  The fact that Dan has a point of view different from yours, mine or Al&#8217;z is the strength of this forum. If all we want to do is listen to people who think like we do, we can just listen to Fox News.  And please, don&#8217;t tell me that Al&#8217;z is the new prototypical Republican &#8212; there are Republicans who despise the far right&#8217;s blindness, stupidity and faux moralism as much as we do the far left&#8217;s excesses.  I have little in common with Tom deLay, Rick Santorum, Trent Lott, Orrin Hatch, John Ashcroft, Dick Cheney and other Congressional and administration leaders, but that doesn&#8217;t automatically put me in bed with the Kerrys, Clintons and others on that side of the aisle.  </p>
<p>We need to have our perspectives opened and consider ideas that are more than labels.  That, not lockstep uniformity with a political party, is what is needed for better governance.  I often<br />
 disagree with Dan&#8217;s positions, but I respect his intelligence and his willingness to expose those ideas to thoughtful discussion&#8230;and that&#8217;s a hell of a lot more than Al&#8217;z ever did.</p>

<p>Dan, what exactly is this thick line between the banned troll&#8217;s behaviour, and opinionated discussions? Maybe it is a clear to some of you, but it is not obvious to me. Thats the part that worries me.  Where is the line? Is its location different today than yesterday? Does it depend on your mood? The phases of the moon? How do I know when I have crossed it? From the tone of your last post, it seems as if you think I am getting close. Maybe I am already over it. Or maybe you are talking to someone else.  I don&#8217;t know. But you most definitely ARE having a stifling effect on my desire to express my opinions here. Is that your objective? I hope not.</p>
<p>There are people who might have something intelligent to add once in a great while. Will you ban them based on the 80% of their previous posts that are drivel? What if a person has trouble communicating, for whatever reasons, and you just dont get it? Maybe others readers will. Whats the harm in letting it all flow? Bandwidth problems? Pressure from your MIS folks to cut back on disk space requirements? Valid reasons (maybe), but if so, where do you draw the line in deciding who makes the cut?</p>
<p>I think that I am having intelligent discussions here, or at least attempting to. I can think of almost nothing that I have in common with &#8220;Al&#8217;s&#8221;, other then the fact that I am disagreeing with you on your decision to ban posts of your choosing. But others might see it differently. If I am understanding your post correctly, your perception puts me in his category. I find that objectionable myself. Not that that should necessarily matter to you. But I fear that you are starting down the slippery slope to becoming the proverbial echo chamber.  I am becoming more and more convinced each day that such is the natural tendency of web based discussion groups. Please, say it aint so here.  Considering that this seems to be an area of both personal &#038; professional interest to you (as it is to me), I would think you would strive to go above and beyond the call of duty to avoid having that happen in your own personal blog. </p>

<p>Looks like I picked an interesting day to wander back by.</p>
<p>There seems to be considerable confusion as to what is or is not censorship and whether speech within limits is truly free speech.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that when adults are trying to have a conversation and a child throws a tantrum, there is only so much &#8220;just ignore him&#8221; that will be tolerated.  Eventually if the adults hope to continue their conversation the child must be removed from the room.  That&#8217;s not censorship and it&#8217;s not an abuse of free speech.  It even applies if the conversation the adults are having is a heated disagreement.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve criticized Dan&#8217;s positions sometimes (I think he makes far too much of &#8220;blogging&#8221; &#8212; time will reveal whether it changes everything as he predicts or whether it&#8217;s CB radio for the new millennium&#8217;s first decade as I predict) and I&#8217;ve agreed with them sometimes (Congress needs to remember that the companies giving them money are not the parties on whose behalf they are to work).  In neither case has he attempted to stifle my remarks.  Civility is a hallmark of all healthy web journals. I salute him for trying to restore it.</p>

<p>llcoolJJ, here are some examples.</p>
<p>In one case, the person in question falsely claimed that I was a paid shill for the Democratic Party, and that my employer was essentially a political action committee in disguise. I didn&#8217;t delete his comment, but rather responded that his assertion was false and that he should not repeat it. He kept saying it. At one point he tried to evade the issue by saying this was his &#8220;opinion&#8221; as if that somehow changed what he was doing.</p>
<p>He also alleged that my postings about Bush called the president and his administration a bunch of fascists. This was another blatant and ugly lie. I told him to stop. He continued.</p>
<p>Still another person (I assume a different person) forged my name on postings. They were right-leaning in tone, but I&#8217;d have booted anyone of any political leaning who did that.</p>
<p>These are not mere differences of opinion.</p>

<p>But you&#8217;re not reading it. The power of the individual, in this case Dan, allows him to decide what&#8217;s appropriate for this forum. The power of the state &#8212; i.e., Big Brother or Big Mother &#8212; shouldn&#8217;t intervene in deciding what he thinks is appropriate or not. Sure, Dan works for a company that&#8217;s a giant media enterprise, but this is Dan&#8217;s sandbox, not the company&#8217;s nor is it mine or yours.</p>
<p>We can create our own sandboxes and express our own opinions. The reason a number of people are down on Dan&#8217;s decision is that they think this forum is important. It is. So they want Dan, who created and makes this forum important, to not have any say over how the forum is run. Wrong. </p>

<p>Voting the idiots off the island is a misapplication of democracy.  The highest and best form of government is the rule of a wise king (when it can be had).  I&#8217;m for a more active moderation.  Dan, I&#8217;d love it if you&#8217;d treat any posts that you find to be vacuous, or malicious, or flat-out wrong as spam.  Delete them without a second thought.  The end result will be a better blog.</p>

<p>OK, Dan that helps. Thanks.</p>
<p>Putting false words in anothers mouth is not good in any case, and forging someones name is highly objectionable.  Repeating the offenses magnifies the problem, and also makes it easier to justify banishment, especially after a warning.  Those are good points.</p>
<p>And to clarify my thoughts, I do feel that this blog is your baby, to do with as you see fit. No argument from me on that perspective. You have the right (and responsibility, as they say) to control its destiny.  I personally fear the risk of your throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and thats why I dont like any added controls.  That is just an opinion, and I do appreciate the opportunity to share it here.</p>

<p>My blog seems to attract more trolls via email than comments (I&#8217;ve gotten some vicious emails from extreme right-wingers, and I don&#8217;t have that many readers). I can only imagine how bad it gets with a more popular blog. Almost makes me grateful for obscurity 🙂</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t generally comment here, and a few other blogs I really like, as a lot of the time it seems right-wingers are just sitting around waiting to pounce. I don&#8217;t mind being challenged, but frankly I don&#8217;t find the tone they offer very intellectually stimulating. I&#8217;m tired of arguing the same basic points over and over again. I have better things to do. </p>
<p>I think Eric Alterman&#8217;s edited letters format, in lieu of comments, has a lot of value. Filters are important; things that are filtered are usually worth more than things that aren&#8217;t. Filter away, I say, and the sooner the better. Those who want to spew are welcome to put up their own blogs.  </p>

<p>Susan> &#8220;a lot of the time it seems right-wingers are just sitting around waiting to pounce. I don&#8217;t mind being challenged, but frankly I don&#8217;t find the tone they offer very intellectually stimulating.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just said essentially the same thing about the left-wing nuts that inhabit the blogs. What I wrote on another blog was: &#8220;I&#8217;m no fan of some Bush policies, but don&#8217;t you find it the least worrying that those presenting arguments against Bush dance around like water drops on a hot skillet whenever the logic is cut out from under them?&#8221;</p>
<p>So undoubtedly it&#8217;s true about both sides. </p>
<p>I followed it up concluding, &#8220;If we&#8217;re going to get civil discussion back on track, it&#8217;s time for us to begin to laugh at those who consistently resort to baseless canards.&#8221;</p>

<p>yes, I understand the problem, and just letting it go is far from a perfect solution. Unfortunately, there don&#8217;t seem to be any really good solutions. I&#8217;ve already indicated why I don&#8217;t think a distributed moderation scheme is a particularly good solution either: moderators are, in practice, often tempted to flag as &#8220;trolls&#8221; posts they simply don&#8217;t agree with. That&#8217;s to be expected, given that we&#8217;re dealing with a situation in which regular posters cannot be relied upon to behave themselves; that is, in fact, the very essence of the problem.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate, but it looks very much like the choice is to pick the least objectionable solution. Considering all the alternatives, I think &#8220;just let it go and ignore the trolls&#8221; might just be it. I don&#8217;t like it that much myself either, it&#8217;s just that I can&#8217;t see an obviously better solution out there&#8230;</p>

<p>Ann&#8217;s Cooter> &#8220;Thanks sbw for taking my idea and making it your own &#8211; work for Microsoft by chance?&#8221;</p>
<p>I overlooked your earlier post. It is, however, a suggestion I had made some months back on an earlier topic in Dan&#8217;s comments. So, you must have &#8220;Microsoft&#8221;-ed my idea. That&#8217;s okay. As a youngster once asked friends in our car, bickering over irrelevancies, &#8220;What does it matter?!&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m an another &#8220;Al&#8221;.  (I don&#8217;t know many Al&#8217;s post here!)  I&#8217;ve posted a few dozen times (I&#8217;m guessing) and I&#8217;m wondering if I&#8217;m considered a &#8220;troll&#8221;.  I have to ask, though: what is a &#8220;troll&#8221; in this context?  Is it someone who disagrees with Dan&#8217;s views? If it goes down to some of the infighting, then there are trolls on all sides.</p>
<p>The reality is it&#8217;s Dan gig.  He can do what he wants.  If he wants to shut someone off, he can and he probably isn&#8217;t technically obligated to tell anyone about it.</p>
<p>With that said, it could backfire on him because it might turn some other people off.  I dislike the infighting, the one-upsmanship that goes on, but aren&#8217;t these civility problems one of the problems we face as a society?  It could be several discussion topics by itself.</p>
<p>Civility is important. We&#8217;ll never get our problems solved if we&#8217;re fighting.</p>
<p>Civility, however, takes effort.  I think I try to be civil.  The one thing that I deal with is resolving Dan&#8217;s journalistic approach with his pointed, seemingly partisan, views. I think it&#8217;s a valid issue and I&#8217;ve tried to be civil about it. On the other hand, I&#8217;ve made come &#8220;cracks&#8221; that might be considered by some to be too strong.</p>
<p>Anyways, this Blog is good.  Even though Dan is a lefty, I think there is room here for dissenting ideas.</p>
<p>For making the Bl<br />
og better, I guess I&#8217;d focus on the civility angle.  I&#8217;m sure you all have some ideas on how to do this.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, this is a microcosm of freedom itself: with freedom comes responsibilities.  Civility is one of them.</p>
<p>(This could be an example of why morals and ethics are important for our society to function. For this Blog to work, there has to be some rules; for society to work, there has to be some rules.  For the Blog, it&#8217;s Dan&#8217;s rules to a point; if he wants a strong Blog, then he has to deal with the &#8220;cumulative rules of behavior&#8221; that have developed over time for guiding many different peoples in how to interact with the Blog and it&#8217;s readers.<br />Society has the same issues and it&#8217;s why conservatives feel the left abandons the &#8220;cumulative rules of behavior&#8221; that have developed over hundreds of years.  It&#8217;s the culture war.)</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>

<p>As much as troll&#8217;s suck&#8230;banning sucks more.    </p>
<p>Having tried to honestly participate on some of the web&#8217;s most ideologically unappealing radical sites (freerepublic &#038; democratic underground), I now find the policy of banning dissenting troll opinions even more unappealing.    </p>
<p>IMHO, let the trolls make asses of themselves and make the rest of us (on both the left &#038; right) look like we actually know what we&#8217;re talking about.    </p>

<p>Al&#8217;s asks and answers the most critical question for this track: &#8220;What is a troll?&#8221; I think his answer is congruent with Dan&#8217;s definition (which a number of us have supported in our reactions): a troll violates the group&#8217;s &#8212; not just Dan&#8217;s &#8212; rules of civility.  A troll betrays the social contracts that allow us to disagree without being disagreeable. Savagely derogatory comments, personal attacks, lies, sabotage and misrepresentation are not tolerated in polite company anywhere. Bad manners are simply not conducive to productive discourse.</p>
<p>The majority of contributors have demonstrated the capacity to debate issues with power and passion but without stooping to juvenile or bullying behavior.  A very few have not, wherein lies the crux of the problem for Dan.</p>
<p>This issue of following basic rules of civilized human behavior is critical to our democratic (small &#8216;d&#8217;) culture, and the loss of civility is a key to the breakdown in legislative bodies across the country.  </p>
<p>In this microcosm of that environment, Dan states his opinions and welcomes, even promotes, alternative viewpoints. It&#8217;s not an intimidating environment, and clearly there are articulate advocates on both sides.  That&#8217;s why many of us come back in spite of the few trolls.</p>

<p>Dan,</p>
<p>If Al&#8217;s made posts that attacked you or your employer in a personal matter I guess I missed them.  Maybe you deleted them before I could read them.  That type of post would be over the line.  </p>
<p>I post on here because even though conservatives are in the minority you can usually have a civil discussion.  That isn&#8217;t the case on a lot of other political forums or blogs that I visit.</p>
<p>I still believe though that in a lot of cases the left&#8217;s notion of &#8220;free speech&#8221; only applies to them. How many university campuses have no problem with a campus group inviting Al Franken but refuse to let one invite say Clarence Thomas?</p>

<p>Rick, I don&#8217;t think any of my posts have been deleted.  I could be wrong and I haven&#8217;t really checked, but I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve been bad enough to censor!  I was just &#8220;thinking aloud&#8221; about the things I&#8217;ve said that could be considered a problem (by Dan).</p>

<p>What is a troll?</p>
<p>Confucius honestly did advise people not to do to others what you wouldn&#8217;t want done to you. It was a more practical &#8220;Golden Rule&#8221;.</p>
<p>A troll doesn&#8217;t follow Confucius&#8217; good advice and could be looked at two ways: In the first view, the mythical troll is inconsiderate of others. In the second view, the troll, for self-validation, is fishing (trolling) for reaction that, even if it is negative, gives the troll a sense of self-worth.</p>
<p>In both instances we are dealing with mentally sick people who cannot themselves see it.</p>
<p>Also, both instances deserve to be separated from others who simply haven&#8217;t learned to use rhetoric constructively or have forgotten, in the heat of an argument, that ideas stand apart from the person who thinks them.</p>

<p>What I haven&#8217;t seen in suggestions above (but may have missed) is a feature analogous to Amazon&#8217;s &#8220;people who bought x also bought a, b and c&#8221; &#8211; where you (the reader) would use &#8220;positive moderation&#8221;, and see only those comments that others _whose opinions you trusted_ had considered to be &#8220;adult&#8221; (in the original sense of the word)</p>
<p>Or maybe website owner could somehow designate certain readers as &#8220;trusted moderators&#8221;, whose opinions (via IP address) would count more than others &#8211; and whose ranks could grow or shrink depending on quality of their judgement.</p>
<p>Alternatively, require that posters be in the fMRI while posting, and verify that the appropriate area of their brain is active. (I think this is a &#8220;future feature&#8221;)</p>

<p>I&#8217;d be concerned about a rating system like e-Bay or other commercial and public opinion sites, for a couple of reasons:<br />1) They are subject to manipulation by unscrupulous parties&#8230;probably the same kinds of minds that cause the current problem.<br />2) Like All-Star voting, they can reflect numbers and popularity, not quality.  Many, perhaps most, of the contributors are decidedly liberal&#8230;should they be expected to objectively rate the value of opposing views.  Oh, if we humans were so good!<br />3) They complicate what should be a relatively simple on-line exchange of viewpoints.  Instead of taking place informally as it currently works.  In business terms, it move water-cooler discussions to the Board Room.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a fast reader, and I found myself skimming through and ignoring some of the most strident postings from both sides.  I still think that laissez faire approach is best, but also understand Dan&#8217;s dilemma when people abuse our trust.</p>

<p>You do need the opt<br />
ion to nuke a malicious troll &#8212; one who impersonates the moderator or another comment maker. Subverting the system revokes the right to use the system. </p>
<p>However, most trolls are best treated first by ignoring them. It frustrates the hell out of them. [Dan&#8217;s been doing this for a long time.]</p>
<p>A second step was used by Jay Rosen of &#8220;pressThink&#8221; who let a troll carry on for a very long time, tried to communicate with him privately, and then, in the comment section, dissected the techniques used by the troller to explain why what he was doing was anti-social and unacceptable. Only after even this failed was the troller banned. [It has to be done sometimes&#8230; I&#8217;m sure that to this day the troller mistakenly thinks he was mistreated.]</p>
<p>So there are stages between the velvet glove and iron fist. We believe in our business that by the time someone is fired, they should have ample understanding so that, if they were prepared to look, they could have seen what was coming.</p>

<p>It has been fascinating to watch the comments roll in and evolve. The ideas on civility are good ones (good old fashion ones). Keep them coming.</p>
<p>It seems everyone is in favor of &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221; &#8211;as long as it is not given to those whom we think we disagree with.</p>
<p>Echoes from the Tower of Babbel resonate strongly here. Just slap a one-word label on the other guy (or gal) and then you are sure you know exactly who they are and where they come from.</p>
<p>Why you are nothing but an intolerant Republican! Oh yeh, well you are a soft-hearted, money-wasting Democrat, and besides, your mother wears Army &#8230;.</p>
<p>There was a time when a &#8220;conservative&#8221; was someone who tried to slow civilation&#8217;s encroachment on Nature&#8217;s wilderness.</p>
<p>There was time when people had long, substantive discussions rather than flinging one-word or one-grunt epithets at each other.</p>
<p>That was then. This now. Where has all the civility gone?</p>

<p>Whoah!  Straw-man alert!  Both Al and spelling error are trying to cast this as a censorship issue.  This is not about censorship:  This is about removing a disruptive jerk from an otherwise civil discussion, no different from the regular ejection of certain left-wing wackos from Santa Cruz City Council meetings when they act sufficiently obnoxious that city business can no longer be discussed.</p>

<p>no-on-censorship:</p>
<p>You started off with a first sentence that we all can agree with: civility is good. After that, I heartily disagree.</p>
<p>But many others here would disagree about disagreeing. The problem is not with contrary opinions, it is with the delivery. See sentence 1.</p>
<p>The troll[s] are may be contrary, but that has *never* been complained about. It is the method and conduct of their behavior that has *consistently* been a source of complaint.</p>
<p>I think the best solution of all is to disallow *any* anonymous contributions. If you can&#8217;t stand up for what you are saying *face to face* you should sit down and shut up. Of course, there are niggling little technical issues implementing and enforcing this, but the price to speak should be standing behind your words.</p>
<p>p.s. I actually enjoy well-reasoned opinions contary to my own. Constant re-evaluation of beliefs is a healthy habit&#8230;. I believe there are many other participants here who share that feeling.</p>

<p>Suppose I work in the advertising business. If I write something bad about one of my prime clients, even if it is true, there will be hell to pay for it. People are not above petty revenge and retaliation. Democracy is not as simple in practice as it is in concept.</p>
<p>Dear Peter:<br />Kick out the trolls like you do in Santa Cruz?<br />This is not the same environment.<br />If you don&#8217;t like a troll&#8217;s e-comments, you can simply skip past them. Don&#8217;t click open the comments section. It&#8217;s that easy. Commenting in e-space is not the same as commenting in a physical forum.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why there is no hardly any excuse for complete censureship in e-space.</p>
<p>(Of course, if the troll downloads a 10Giga byte rant into the comment space, that would be another matter)</p>

<p>Here we are discussing &#8220;trolls&#8221; and you don&#8217;t even use your name. So when are you willing to stand up for your beliefs? Your choice of profession is a *choice*. Money or free expression?</p>

<p>For those of you who are happy to just skip past the flaming posts, that&#8217;s great, but keep in mind that not everyone feels the same way.  </p>
<p>A thought experiment: if, empirically, Studies Show that the majority of readers consider a comments section loaded with trolls to be less valuable (and less worth even bothering to visit) than one with without, do you think that evicting the trolls would be justified?  (They&#8217;re not exactly an endangered species, there&#8217;s plenty of other troll habitat available.)</p>
<p>Actually, trolls have a lot in common with gophers.  They live underground, given the choice between raw land and your lawn they prefer to deface your lawn (but hey, you can just skip past looking at those piles of dirt amidst the grass right?), and if not controll<br />
ed they multiply and take it over.</p>

<p>Is it possible to use the concept of the old &#8220;killfiles&#8221;? Each registered user would have a list of posters whose posts don&#8217;t appear on screen. The trolls see their own posts, but don&#8217;t know that the people who are annoyed by them can&#8217;t see them. Even if they change identity, all it would take for other users is clicking a button that says &#8220;Add this poster to killfile.&#8221; </p>

<p>I have a nice, overly-complicated proposal.</p>
<p>Writing styles are distinctive to a degree (like our fingerprints).  Measuring word frequency is one way to identify and partially describe a person&#8217;s writing style. </p>
<p>So take some of this guy&#8217;s posts and run them through a script that measures the frequency he uses distinctive words and short phrases. Select some of his most frequent characteristic words or short phrases, that you know most other posters don&#8217;t use.  </p>
<p>When a post shows up that matches this word profile; look at it. If it is from this guy, don&#8217;t post to it but just put a link to it instead. Call it something like &#8220;gumball post&#8221; so everyone will know why the link is there. Squelched a few times, this poster will be discouraged enough to either go away, or to moderate his replies. </p>

<p>How about a registration system, perhaps with some tracking of IP or computer information?</p>
<p>Then comments can be disallowed from users who violate the rules, and ID&#8217;s withheld from an IP/computer where earlier users have trangressed.</p>
<p>Not perfect, but it will make it harder for the folks who continue to violate the rules.  That should bring the noise down.</p>

<p>How do the financial repercussions Whoopee paid have anything to do with free speech?  She signed a contract with those people to do advertising.  </p>
<p>Like most contracts it has a standard clause that says if she does anything in her personal life that embarrasses the company they have the right to fire her.  The customers complained and they did.  </p>
<p>She was still free to say what she did even though she had to know there was a chance it would cost her financially.</p>
<p>Now what Cheney said was regrettable.  But only those who have never told someone to f&#8212; off in their private lives have the right to criticize.  Quite frankly it makes him all too human, quite rare for a career politician ;&lt;).</p>

<p>Dave, you said: &#8220;Your efforts to silence or censor abusive, trollish comments will never work. Only by including dissent will you ever succeed at opening minds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you believe dissent includes the right to repeatedly make false and possibly defamatory statements, even after being told the statements are false? Does it include the right to forge my name on postings? My answer to both is No.</p>

<p>This just in from the US Supreme Court by a 5-4 vote:<br />The 1st Amendment does not cover forging Dan&#8217;s name.<br />It also does not cover yelling &#8220;fire&#8221; in the movie theater, even if the movie you are watching is Farenheit 9/11.</p>
<p>Rick,<br />You miss your own point. Cheney signed a social contract to be civil on the Senate floor. He breached his contract. However, justice is not distributed evenly amongst those who break their promises. Whoopee is a left-wing commie Hollywood whacko, so she deserves to be whacked. Besides she&#8217;s not human, she&#8217;s female &#038; black. Cheney on the other hand, is a well-connected white guy. Therefore he is &#8220;human&#8221;. He shows his human side by using profanity. It is refreshing to see such humanity on the Senate floor. I get it. I hope everyone else does also.</p>

<p>No-on, Cheney&#8217;s contract is up for renewal this November. You may personally contribute to his &#8220;whacking&#8221; at that time. Assuming you are able to vote in the US, of course.</p>

<p>I will forgive Cheney for his vulgar language, <br />&#8230; but not for his Words of Mass Deception (WMDs) and for their causing needless loss of life, needless maiming of the many more, including US soldiers who come back as damaged human assests via Germany so that the numbers of such casualties cannot be counted by the VA here in the USA, and for the needless waste of tax payer money. ($87 Billion here, another there, and soon you&#8217;re talking real money &#8230; but at least I&#8217;m not being terrorized. That made it all worthwhile.)</p>
<p>Thanks cool-JJ</p>

<p>Dan Gillmor continues to spread the nonsense that a troll here &#8220;repeatedly [made] false and possibly <br />defamatory statements&#8221;.</p>
<p>Two postings above shred that pitiful, Martha Stewart style spin to tatters.</p>

<p>&#8220;what seemed to push you over the line was Al/Mc&#8217;s interesting argument that your paycheck from Knight Ridder for promoting liberal, anti-Bush points of view should be treated like any other ##soft-money corporate campaign donation##, as your opinions so often mimic those of the DNC and the Kerry campaign, you are paid by corporate money, and corporate money funds distribution of your newspaper and the maintenance of this web site.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it not a stretch to call such an argument &#8216;defamation&#8217;? That is a serious charge, and you shouldn&#8217;t make it so lightly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a fact to call the Bush administration a radical right-wing operation on most issues. It&#8217;s not factual to call<br />
 these folks fascists, even if some of them might like that kind of power.&#8217; -Dan Gillmor, June 29, 2004.</p>
<p>So, Dan is saying that they&#8217;re only fascist *wannabes*, because they haven&#8217;t overthrown our system of constitutional government yet.</p>
<p>Sorry, Dan, your infamous troll is not the one telling a blatent and ugly lie. You plainly suggest with these words that some members of the Bush Administration *aspire* to fascism.</p>
<p>That is a terribly divisive and mean spirited thing to say, just because you find yourself on the opposite end of the political spectrum.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan, you&#8217;re no Martha Stewart.  It seems here that among your readers there are those who suggest you ought to be regulated like a soft-money hack, if you behave like one.  Another says (quite reasonably) that you insinuate Bush&#8217;s crowd aspires to fascist power.</p>
<p>They are reasonable arguments.  I know you don&#8217;t like them, but it&#8217;s very disappointing and revealing that you censor such comments here.</p>

<p>Jonathan:</p>
<p>Let me defend Dan a bit, since he seems to be busy right now.  First let me say that I am against banning anyone for any reason, but Dans got a right to do as he pleases.  Dan claims that he banned this person for 2 reasons. 1) forging other peoples names 2) repeatedly stating that other posters have said things that they didnt say. The person was apparently ignored several warnings to cease and desist.  </p>
<p> I can live with that. Is it just a coincidence that the banned one also happened to be a hard core, right wing poster? Maybe, maybe not. But I am willing to trust Dan on this one. I dont know how it could be proved one way or the other, but it shouldnt have to be anyway.</p>
<p>And for the record, I think the soft money angle thing was an interesting angle.  Is Dan a paid shill for the DNC, or John Kerry, or some other left wing group?  I have to admit, that to me at least, he does APPEAR to be some times.  But that doesnt mean he is. </p>
<p>This whole episode has caused me to go back and read many of my postings here and at some other blogs.  I have to admit that I can see how it would APPEAR to others here that I am a shill for right wing groups.  But I can assure you, that is not the case.</p>
<p>The problem is that I rarely respond to any posts by Dan (or anyone else) with which I agree.  Its not that I am a mean person, or that I just like to argue ( I hope).  It probably has more to do with laziness, or maybe time management is a more positive word.  Plus I really dont like to just echo or ditto topics I agree with.    I usually only post when I see something that is incongruous, illogical, or just plain stupid (in my opinion).  There are very few occasions (like now) when I will just state an opinion or make an observation.</p>
<p>There are people at some right leaning blogs who are convinced that I am left of Dan, and for the same reasons mentioned above. I assure you, that most definitely aint so. But I make no attempts there, or here,  to make myself appear to be fair and balanced.  I dont think that should be expected or required in such an environment. If that costs me credibility, so be it.  Similarly, when writing for his employer, Dan might have an obligation to appear balanced, but he has no such oblilgation here in his blog. Its his call.</p>

<p>llcoolJJ, the &#8220;repeatedly stating other posters have said things they didn&#8217;t say&#8221; was accusation was actually about the two items I referenced above, and explicitly led to comment deletions and banning, and this ridiculous &#8220;my troll problem&#8221; episode.</p>
<p>I happened to be fortunate enough to see the deleted postings before they disappeared, and Scott and Howard nailed it.</p>
<p>Dan banned Al/Mc/whatever because he/they posted what Scott and Howard accurately reference from Dan&#8217;s earlier postings.  </p>
<p>These are reasonable arguments and interpretations of Dan&#8217;s own words, from a right winger.</p>
<p>He was banned because he&#8217;s/they&#8217;re a right winger</p>

<p>Jonathan, he was banned for the reasons I stated. He wasn&#8217;t &#8220;interpreting&#8221; my postings. He was making things up, and when told to stop he kept doing it. You may believe his politics were the reason, but you are incorrect. If political views got people banned here, it would have happened long before now.</p>

<p>The posters above nailed it.  </p>
<p>Dan, you very clearly have in the past insinuated that members of the Bush Administration aspire to fascism.</p>
<p>And, it it fair to ask &#8230; if you behave like a soft money hack for the Democrats, while taking corporate money from a media conglomerate like Knight Ridder, all the while assiduously denying you are a &#8220;straight&#8221; journalist but a columnist instead &#8230; why you shouldn&#8217;t regulated like any Democrat soft money funded talking head.</p>
