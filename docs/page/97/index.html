				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>The message is a little confusing, but three-quarters of Internet denizens who download music files don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re stealing, and they don&#8217;t care if the music is copyrighted, according to a <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/reports/toc.asp?Report=23">new report</a> from the Pew Internet Project.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who share music with other Internet users think they are doing the high-tech equivalent of swapping cassette tapes with their friends,&#8221; Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Internet &#038; American Life Project, said in a press release. &#8220;They don&#8217;t agree with record companies and music artists who contend that Napster users are doing the same thing as walking into a record store and swiping a CD.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latter finding &#8212; that people don&#8217;t care about copyrights &#8212; is a bit disturbing. Sometimes people <i>are</i> stealing, such as when they download songs they don&#8217;t already own in other media, such as a CD, fully intending to keep and listen to the music without buying it. (That&#8217;s assuming they are actually able to go out any buy it, which isn&#8217;t always the case.)</p>
<p>But many of the people in the survey said they&#8217;d bought at least some of the music they got online. I&#8217;m glad to hear it.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting findings suggests that people aren&#8217;t downloading lots of music, at least not at the moment. Still, almost 30 percent said they had more than 25 songs on their computers. As hard disks get bigger and Internet connections speed up, that number is bound to grow.</p>
<p>The survey was released just before one of the most pivotal portions of the Napster case. Next week, a federal appeals court will hear Napster&#8217;s appeal of a ruling that it should be shut down for copyright infringement. More than Napster&#8217;s future is at risk here. Stay tuned.</p>

<p><font size=4>California&#8217;s Governor Doesn&#8217;t Get It</font> </p>
<p>Gov. Gray Davis of California <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/premium/business/docs/internet26.htm">has vetoed a bill</a> (Mercury News) that would have brought a modicum of fairness to the Internet sales tax scene. The legislation would have required companies with retail stores in California to charge sales taxes on items they sell to Californians through the Internet. </p>
<p>A gaping loophole gives companies the green light to let customers dodge the taxes that help pay for essential services. Now this loophole, which the bill would have closed without even considering the really serious Internet taxation issues, has been endorsed by a governor who plainly cares more about kowtowing to the richest industry in history than ensuring the state&#8217;s fiscal soundness. Watch other states race to see who can be more irresponsible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imposing sales taxes on Internet transactions at this point in its young life would send the wrong signal about California&#8217;s international role as the incubator of the dot-com community,&#8221; said the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/bill/asm/ab_2401-2450/ab_2412_vt_20000923.html">veto message</a> over Davis&#8217; signature.</p>
<p>Whoever wrote that line was either misinformed or deceitful.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/bill/asm/ab_2401-2450/ab_2412_bill_20000830_enrolled.html">AB 2412</a>, the legislation in question, was aimed at companies like Borders and Barnes &#038; Noble. The bookstore chains claim that their Internet sales sites are totally unrelated to their stores. Thus, they say, they don&#8217;t have to charge sales taxes even in states where they&#8217;re doing business from physical locations &#8212; the line typically drawn to determine who&#8217;s required to charge sales taxes.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t blame the retailers. They&#8217;re facing the competition from the mail-order industry and online giants like Amazon, which use a longstanding loophole that gives them the ability not to charge sales taxes for out-of-state sales in states where they don&#8217;t have a nexus. That&#8217;s the bigger, and ultimately more important, issue that Congress will have to face someday.</p>
<p>But the pretense that Barnes &#038; Noble&#8217;s online arm isn&#8217;t connected at all to the stores is ludicrous, even if it&#8217;s now legal. Davis vetoed a bill that endorsed common sense. He bowed to the richest industry in history, the technology companies that claim to disdain government but then lobby successfully for an industrial policy that undermines Main Street.</p>
<p>Watch now as other retailers with stores in California race to set up &#8220;unaffiliated&#8221; Web sites. I hope someone will hold Gray Davis to account when his ill-considered veto comes back to haunt us all.</p>

<p>Last week, when I was in Washington on other business, I stopped by the National Public Radio studios to do one of my periodic question-and-answer segments on the Morning Edition program. The topic this time was peer-to-peer technology, and <a href="http://www.npr.org/ramfiles/me/20000927.me.08.rmm">here&#8217;s how the (edited) discussion went</a>.</p>

<p>Will Congress respond? Or will we learn, once and for all, that our lawmakers are much more interested in the rights of businesses to do what they please with our most personal information than our rights to keep some things private?</p>

				<p>The Reuters wire service doesn&#8217;t have enough real journalism to do these days, apparently. Today it put out a pathetic <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/internet/docs/434307l.htm">&#8220;news story&#8221;</a> about two utterly meaningless polls.</p>
<p>These surveys are the typical Web-jobs, those click-through numbers that are totally unscientific and therefore without any meaning. In each, a majority of the self-selected voters disagreed with President Clinton&#8217;s decision to tap the Strategic Oil Reserve.</p>
<p>I happen to disagree with Clinton&#8217;s move. It&#8217;s cynically political in the short run and dangerous in the long term. The oil reserve was meant for wars. OPEC may be shooting economic weapons, but the current situation, however painful, doesn&#8217;t begin to rise to a level serious enough to justify tapping the reserve.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t expect the people running Yahoo or Excite to be responsible. They don&#8217;t care about news except as a commodity, as they&#8217;ve repeatedly shown.</p>
<p>I do expect more from Reuters. This kind of reporting is a discredit to our craft.</p>

<p><font size=4>The Intel Debacle</font> </p>
<p>Intel Corp., by far the largest maker of computer chips in the world, is going to grow again this year at a healthy rate. Not healthy enough, as it turns out.</p>
<p>Intel&#8217;s announcement yesterday that it <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/top/docs/intel092200.htm">will not meet analysts&#8217; expectations</a> (Mercury News) for revenues this quarter has <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/016844.htm">freaked out global stock markets</a> (AP) in a major way overnight. Intel&#8217;s stock <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/016844.htm">took a beating</a> (AP) at the opening of Wall Street today, pulling down the overall markets.</p>
<p>The panic is remarkable, because it matched the boundless euphoria that has marked the equities markets in recent times. Pullbacks and mini-panics have come and gone, though, and the paramount question in people&#8217;s minds today is whether this debacle is an indicator of something deeper and more long-term.</p>
<p>It may seem amazing that a company making fabulous profits could do this to a market merely by saying its profits will be slightly less fabulous. But technology investing &#8212; and the market in general these days &#8212; has been a classic example of a momentum mentality. As long as the momentum was strong, share prices rose. The minute the momentum slowed, boom. It&#8217;s what the professionals call &#8220;hitting a wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Will Silicon Valley hit a wall? Lord knows the valley has become a paradigm of the momentum phenomenon. Yet when you look at the money sloshing around the place, it&#8217;s hard to see how the Bay Area economy could take too much of a hit. That&#8217;s what all the smart people say, anyway.</p>
<p>When all the smart people are moving the same way, are they a herd?</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/008416.htm">sent a letter</a> (Reuters) to the federal appeals court hearing the Napster case after the Clinton administration said the government believed Napster Inc. was violating the copyright law.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it important that the court be under no misapprehension that the (DOJ) brief necessarily expresses the view of Congress in this matter,&#8221; Hatch said.</p>
<p>Wow. Maybe there&#8217;s hope yet.</p>

<p><font size=4>&#8220;Death Taxes&#8221; and Lies</font> </p>
<p>The forces who want to kill off estate taxes haven&#8217;t succeeded in getting the law changed, but their PR campaign to call these levies &#8220;death taxes&#8221; has succeeded. And partly as a result, they&#8217;re <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/opinion/perspective/docs/estatetax17.htm">getting close to an outright repeal</a>. The fact that it would further widen the divisions between the ultra-wealthy and the rest of society is, apparently, irrelevant to policy makers.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s remember what an estate tax actually is. It&#8217;s not a tax on the person who died. It&#8217;s a tax on a gift to the survivor. That is, it taxes income to the survivor. We tax income in this country, as we should.</p>
<p>The rich and powerful don&#8217;t think they should pay <i>any</i> taxes, of course. And they particularly loathe taxes on unearned income, the money created by appreciation of assets, for example. In a society that gave a damn about justice unearned income would be the most heavily taxed of all, because people who actually work for a living deserve the most breaks. </p>
<p>Raise the level at which the inheritance tax kicks in. But don&#8217;t repeal it.</p>

<p><font size=4>Silicon Valley Still Cooking </font> </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/companies/sv150/091800/overview091800.htm">Silicon Valley 150</a> kept roaring ahead during the first half of the year. Everyone knows it can&#8217;t last forever, but this is one amazing ride.</p>

<p><font size=4>AT&#038;T and BT</font> </p>
<p>Wall Street Journal: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/462371.asp">AT&#038;T to consider link ups with British Telecom units</a>. <i>While the two sides haven&#8217;t ruled out a complete merger, AT&#038;T will now focus on merging specific operations, such as AT&#038;T&#8217;s business-services division with BT&#8217;s business-customer unit.</i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Peculiar deal, if it&#8217;s happening. Two of the oldest and, apparently, clumsiest of the old guard don&#8217;t seem likely to put together anything that leverages their strengths. As David Isenberg has said, this deal sounds like <a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/stories/storyReader$474">one plus one equals one, value subtracted</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wired News: <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,38824,00.html">Internet Land Rush at Trademark Office</a>. <i>Individuals and companies are filing trademark applications for trademarks that include domain names in yet-to-be-created top-level domains (TLD) like .web,.firm and .sex.</i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Since the <a href="http://www.wipo.org">World Intellectual Property Organization</a> tends to hand over domain names to people holding trademarks, these moves are designed to preserve names when or if new top-level domains actually happen.</p>
<p>In other words, people are thinking way ahead. By the time <a href="http://www.icann.org">ICANN</a> does its job (ha) it will be too late. The real answer to this problem is an unlimited number of TLDs, but that would annoy powerful people and corporations. We can&#8217;t have that, can we?</p></blockquote>

				<p>I said it yesterday and I&#8217;ll say it again today. The persecution and long imprisonment of Wen Ho Lee, who was only freed from solitary confinement after pleading guilty under outrageous duress to a felony count, is a dismal chapter in American history. </p>
<p>At least President Clinton has had the decency to be modestly contrite, saying he was <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/docs/043442.htm">&#8220;quite troubled&#8221;</a> by the way the case was handled. Clinton&#8217;s attorney general maintained the Justice Department&#8217;s arrogant stance.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>FCC Looks into Open Access: Too Little, Too Late </font> </p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission, at long last, is going to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1094-2000Sep13.html">look into the question</a> of whether cable companies should be required to allow other Internet service providers than the ones they control to offer access to cable-data customers, according to the Washington Post.</p>
<p>This is a long-overdue move, and it&#8217;s probably too late.</p>
<p>The context is America Online&#8217;s grossly anti-consumer buyout of Time Warner, which is moving along pretty much as expected despite worries from people like me. If the FCC had really cared about this issue, it would have moved much sooner.</p>
<p>AOL Time Warner will be a powerhouse in all kinds of ways. Consumers will be losers. This is what happens when the people charged with preserving competition hide their eyes. </p>

<p>Upside: <a href="http://www.upside.com/News/39c0353b0.html">Courtney Love demands some MP3.com cash</a>. <i>Universal executives said in court papers, on Web pages and in one well-publicized speech that they were battling MP3.com at least partly to protect Universal&#8217;s performers, a group that includes everyone from rap star Eminem to soul crooner Barry White to Love&#8217;s own grunge-rock band, Hole.</i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>But share the windfall &#8212; the gains Universal may make from its MP3.com lawsuit &#8212; with the artists? Ha ha. Good joke.</p></blockquote>
