				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>See <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,34006,00.html">Wired News</a> today. I&#8217;d quibble with the assertion that content is king on the Net, which has yet to be proved, but it&#8217;s a good piece otherwise.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>More Bad News from the Privacy Front</font></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been making it a point lately to test the privacy features of Web sites and other kinds of interactions I have with businesses. I do this both because I want to guard my own privacy, and to collect data for this journal.</p>
<p>The latest news is, I&#8217;m not surprised to say, the usual dismal stuff.</p>
<p><b>SkyMall&#8217;s Weasely Language</b></p>
<p>On a plane last week I saw an item in the <a href="http://www.skymall.com">SkyMall</a> catalog that I wanted to buy. I ordered via the Web site, where the privacy statement says, in part:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><i>If you have made a purchase at skymall.com, registered for one of our affiliated services or benefits programs, or signed up for another special offer or opportunity, we may occasionally update you via email of specific opportunities we feel may be of special interest to you, or we may supply your name to carefully screened companies who we feel may have products or services which will be of interest to you. If you would prefer not to receive notice of such opportunities, simply indicate this during the checkout process: simply make sure the box next to the statement &#8220;Please make my name available to carefully screened companies whose products and services may be of interest to me&#8221; is not checked.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>No such box exists.</p>
<p>Now, there is a box at the beginning of the checkout process that says, &#8220;Yes! Please keep me up to date on skymall.com products and services which may be of interest to me.&#8221; A SkyMall spokeswoman, who seemed surprised to learn that the language in the &#8220;Privacy Statement&#8221; didn&#8217;t exist as a check-off option, told me that this other box was intended to cover all marketing situations &#8212; in other words, if I unchecked it I&#8217;d be removed from any third-party solicitations. Yet the actual box makes no mention whatever of third-party companies, a giant loophole that any lawyer could drive a truck through.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said the site had just been upgraded &#8212; &#8220;It&#8217;s version 3.0,&#8221; she said proudly &#8212; and that there must have been a mistake somewhere. Uh, huh.</p>
<p><b>GTE Wireless and the Hoops Routine</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m shopping for a new mobile phone service, and <a href="http://www.gte.com/Products/wireless.html">GTE Wireless</a> seems to have the best deal for me. But when I called the company to inquire about the privacy of the information I was giving up, I got something between a stonewall and runaround.</p>
<p>First, in a GTE store, a salesperson said she could not give me any more information than was on the &#8220;standard&#8221; contract, which has the usual ambiguous and consumer-unfriendly language. Then I called the company, and was put on hold endlessly as customer-service folks called supervisors to try to get answers to my questions.</p>
<p>I asked how I could ensure that my personal information would not be used for any purpose other than internal record-keeping &#8212; that it would not be bartered, sold or otherwise find its way outside GTE. I was told that had to write a letter to a certain department, which would then mail me a form that I could fill out and fax back to be taken off marketing lists.</p>
<p>Okay, I said, just give me the fax number. I&#8217;ll fax a request for the form, and save the time of waiting for the Postal Service to deliver a letter that might get conveniently lost by the company. No way, said the &#8220;customer service&#8221; person &#8212; I had to write a letter, even though at some point I&#8217;d be faxing the form back to GTE.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious that GTE&#8217;s system is designed to make people like me so weary of the hassle that we&#8217;ll just give up. Then GTE can go about its business of trading our personal information. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be calling GTE&#8217;s public-relations folks for a comment on this minor outrage, and will let you know what they say.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>UPDATE:</p>
<p>Susan Asher, a spokeswoman for GTE Wireless in Atlanta, says I apparently got misinformation from the customer service department. I didn&#8217;t need to fill out a form, and I should have been given the fax number to which I could have simply written an opt-out letter.</p>
<p>That letter would have applied only to what she called internal GTE marketing, according to Asher. &#8220;We don&#8217;t sell customer information for any purpose,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>I asked if the company hired third-party telemarketers to pitch GTE products or services. Sometimes, she said, but they get specific instructions on what they can do &#8212; and must not do &#8212; with that information. </p>
<p>But third-party telemarketers have been known to go beyond such instructions. That&#8217;s why I always opt out of this kind of thing when possible.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Oh, By the Way, Remember Auto-by-Tel?</b></p>
<p>Several years ago, Autobytel.com, the online auto sales outfit, violated its privacy statement with an unspecified number of users. I was one. I&#8217;d opted out of its third-party marketing stuff, and nonetheless got a credit-card solicitation. </p>
<p>What terrible mistake! said Autobytel.com&#8217;s PR person. She said I and others who&#8217;d been pitched despite our specific instructions not to be pitched would be getting letters of apology from the company.</p>
<p>I guess that letter got lost in the mail, after the dog ate it.</p>
<p><b>Microsoft&#8217;s Latest Violation</b></p>
<p>Wired News reports that Microsoft <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,34474,00.html">continues to be surprised</a> by the capabilities of the software it writes and sells. </p>

				<p>The personal computer marketplace is a collection of horizontal slices &#8212; CPU, OS, graphics hardware, apps, etc. Intel and Microsoft own many of those slices, but no company owns them all. This isn&#8217;t the way it was in the mainframe era, a vertical market dominated by IBM.</p>
<p>Vertical-market technology seems to be coming back, in the new information appliances. I explain what I mean by that in my <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/041061.htm">Tuesday column</a> in the San Jose Mercury News.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Microsoft and Justice Face Off Today &#8212; What Has Changed?</font></p>
<p>Our favorite monopolist <a href="http://www.sjmercury.com/breaking/headline2/ms022300.htm">squared off today</a> (Mercury News story) against the U.S. Department of Justice, a bunch of state attorneys general and the District of Columbia. The occasion will be oral arguments in the antitrust case. </p>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson&#8217;s scathing <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/business/microsoft/trial/finding.htm">&#8220;findings of fact&#8221;</a> in the antitrust trial last fall were an obvious prelude to a verdict on the law &#8212; a verdict that almost certainly won&#8217;t come out in favor of Microsoft. The findings led Microsoft to launch a PR offensive. The idea was to convince the public that even if it was found guilty of wrongdoing &#8212; of course, the company continues to insist that day is night and night is day &#8212; the offenses didn&#8217;t justify any serious remedies. </p>
<p>Wrong, wrong, wrong. Microsoft is still by far the most powerful single force in the technology industry. The woe-is-Redmond chorus is a combination of wishful thinking and misinformation.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks Microsoft&#8217;s clout is ebbing should read the March issue of Wired magazine. An article by John Heilemann tells how Silicon Valley&#8217;s most powerful executives <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.03/deepthroat.html">showed all-too-typical cowardice</a> late last year when it came to standing up to Microsoft.  They cravenly ducked when the government asked for public support for stern antitrust remedies. </p>
<p>Since then, Microsoft has reported yet more massive earnings and revenue growth. It continues to generate cash at an accelerated rate despite going on a wild spending spree for new technology to complement Windows and its applications. Those investments guarantee Microsoft a strong position in whatever markets emerge in coming years. Investors have made Microsoft the most valuable company on Earth. This is not what happens to a pitiful, helpless giant.</p>

				<p>Last week in Silicon Valley, Microsoft launched Windows 2000 and Symbian, the mobile-phone companies&#8217; operating system partnership, held a developers conference. These events were about platforms &#8212; the foundations from which technology empires are built. </p>
<p>Actually, I don&#8217;t much like the word platform in this context. I prefer &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; &#8212; it seems more apt.</p>
<p>More on this in my <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg02200.htm">Sunday column</a>, the first of two parts relating to this topic.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>eBay Passwords &#8212; Beware</font></p>
<p>Richard Fromm at Berkeley says <a href="http://avocado.dhs.org/ebpd/">eBay doesn&#8217;t encrypt users&#8217; passwords</a>, and that the online auction site doesn&#8217;t seem especially interested in fixing the problem. </p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>How Apple Compensates Steve Jobs</font></p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s CEO, Steve Jobs, got an airplane and a pile of stock options as compensation. Apple&#8217;s accountants and auditors played some interesting disclosure and accounting games. Read all about it in Jim Mitchell&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/indepth/docs/jobs022000.htm">revealing analysis</a> in today&#8217;s San Jose Mercury News.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Local Equals Long Distance </font></p>
<p>The Swedish telephone company, <a href="http://www.telia.com/bvo/teliacom/main_teliacom.jsp.html?OID=18927">Telia</a>, has told its customers to <a href=" http://han16ns.telia.se/telia/Thk/ThkPre70.nsf/vNyhetEfocusEng/B708CCCC2A20B0A8412568850032EC20">ignore the distinction</a> between local and long distance calls originating on the company&#8217;s land lines. This is a major breakthrough in the world of telecommunications &#8212; or is it?</p>
<p>Actually, it isn&#8217;t. For the past several years I&#8217;ve been using a wireless phone service that also ignores the difference between local and long distance, and which doesn&#8217;t charge extra for roaming. The network doesn&#8217;t care whether I&#8217;m calling around the block or across the nation. Why should the billing department?</p>
<p>This is the future, folks, and it was predicted long ago by none other than Arthur C. Clarke, the great science fiction author. One of these days, it&#8217;ll cost the same to call my relatives in London as it does to call my neighbors. And that cost will approach zero.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>UPDATE: Matts Olsson writes from Sweden:<br /><i>I read your E-journal (as I frequently do) about Telia and their decision to ignore the distinction  between local and long distance calls. The decision was only an response to Telias competitor Tele2. Who had made an exactly similar offer to its customers a couple of days earlier.</i></p></blockquote>

				<p>FBI Director Louis Freeh, who wants to restrict your right to use strong encryption that law enforcement can&#8217;t break, now thinks it&#8217;s a fine idea to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/000217-000002.html">apply federal racketeering laws</a> (Register story) to hacking. Before you applaud, consider what this would mean.</p>
<p>The RICO statutes were originally aimed at so-called kingpins of organized crime, and then became a favored weapon in the War on Some Drugs. The laws invite abuse.</p>
<p>One of the biggest abuses has been in the area of forfeitures, where the government takes property allegedly used for illegal acts. The way the forfeiture laws work, however, is to give the government great incentive to take now and return never, even when the alleged criminal has done nothing wrong. That&#8217;s because the laws put the burden of proof on the person whose property has been taken &#8212; turning the Constitution on its head, but legally because, in the perverse logic accepted by our court, there&#8217;s no harm to the person. It&#8217;s legal theft, and law enforcement does it all the time.</p>
<p>But then, law enforcement would never target an innocent person, right? Just ask all the people who&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/state/updates/lat_rampart000217.htm">framed by the Los Angeles Police Department</a>.</p>

<p><font size=4>The Latest Ridiculous Patent?</font></p>
<p>NextCard, the credit-card company, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/02/17/BU96855.DTL">says it&#8217;s nearing a patent </a> (San Francisco Chronicle) on applying for credit online. If so, this would be yet another example the Patent and Trademark Office gone off its collective rocker.</p>
<p>If taking an application for credit isn&#8217;t obvious, nothing is. Patents are not supposed to be granted for obvious things, but they&#8217;re being granted all the time for things we do in the offline world, with the novelty being that the activity is now online.</p>
<p>Software and business method patents are a total scandal, but Congress and the Patent Office just lets the system keep rolling along. Consumers, and the free enterprise system, will be the ultimate losers in this foolish game.</p>

<p><font size=4>Windows 2000 Bug Reports, Continued </font></p>
<p>Mary Jo Foley, the reporter who wrote of an internal Microsoft document discussing more than 60,000 possible bugs in Windows 2000, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/comment/0,5859,2440594,00.html">got the usual Microsoft treatment</a> along the way. The company wouldn&#8217;t discuss the specifics when she asked for a comment before running her story. Then Microsoft denied the whole thing to everyone else, including me. Then it punished Foley, canceling interviews with senior executives at the Windows 2000 launch.</p>
<p>During the antitrust trial, Microsoft executives repeatedly told the court that internal documents didn&#8217;t mean what they plainly did mean. The judge didn&#8217;t believe a word of their testimony, as his findings of fact proved.</p>
<p>When it comes to believing what Microsoft says, extreme skepticism is always the best approach. See what Microsoft does.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Speaking of the Windows 2000 launch, it was incredibly depressing to see the actor Patrick Stewart shilling for Microsoft. I thought the man had more class.</p></blockquote>

<p><font size=4>Silicon Valley Light Rail &#8212; Not an Easy Commute </font></p>
<p>The other day I had to leave my car at home. I decided to take public transportation to my office. Not fun.</p>
<p>The trip, which takes 20-25 minutes by car, took 75 minutes by a combination of foot, light rail and taxicab. And I didn&#8217;t have wait more than two or three minutes at any stop for the next mode of transportation.</p>
<p>I would much rather take public transit than drive. But not when it takes three times as long to make the trip. That&#8217;s nuts.</p>

				<p>America Online takes strong issue with my <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg021500.htm">Tuesday column</a>, in which I called the company hypocritical for changing its tune on open access in the cable-data market. I&#8217;d cited two highly reputable publications &#8212; reports in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A42393-2000Feb11.html">Washington Post</a> and <a href="http://interactive.wsj.com/archive/retrieve@1.cgi?dgillmor/text/wsjie/data/SB950485221621837868.djm/&#038;NVP=&#038;template=atlas-srch-searchrecent-nf.tmpl&#038;form=atlas-srch-searchrecent-nf.html&#038;from-and=AND&#038;to-and=AND&#038;sort=Article-Doc-Date+desc&#038;qand=&#038;bool_query=open+access&#038;dbname=%26name1%3Ddbname%26name2%3Ddbname%26name3%3Ddbname%26period%3D%3A720&#038;location=article&#038;HI=">Wall Street Journal</a> (paid registration required for this story).</p>
<p>Both got it wrong, and so did I, writes company spokeswoman Kathy Bushkin:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><i>I&#8217;m sorry you didn&#8217;t talk to anyone at AOL about our position on open access before writing about it in your recent column. </p>
<p>If you had, we could have made clear that AOL is as strongly committed to open access today as we were the day before we announced our merger with Time Warner.  In fact, we made it a key point in the announcement of the merger that there would be consumer choice among ISPs on AOL Time Warner cable systems.</p>
<p>We are now actively engaged in developing a plan to make open access a reality in the marketplace and, as a result, the need for legislation is now less urgent so we aren&#8217;t committing the resources to it as we were before. As we bring these two companies together, we are confident that AOL Time Warner will accelerate the delivery of choice, competition and innovation to cable consumers nationwide. </i></p></blockquote>
<p>I know what AOL keeps saying, and I hope it&#8217;s true. But calling the lobbyists off the open-access cause does raise questions, especially given AOL&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>Back in 1995, just before the launch of Windows 95, AOL was leading a charge before the Justice Department to get an antitrust investigation of the Microsoft Network, a competing online service that would have a direct link from the Windows desktop. Microsoft shouldn&#8217;t favor itself, given its dominance of the desktop, AOL correctly said.</p>
<p>But when AOL got favored Windows placement, in return for promoting and adopting Microsoft&#8217;s Web browser, AOL&#8217;s fervent calls for intervention stopped. Other online services and Internet providers were left to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>AOL says it&#8217;ll voluntarily provide open access to other online providers, even though that&#8217;s not in its own best interest. I will believe this when it actually happens.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;ll keep in mind another kind of company that has been claiming to provide similar open access to competitiors &#8212; the local phone monopolies. They&#8217;ve talked a great game but have done little but put obstacles in the way of the companies that want to compete for local service and data connections.</p>
<p>If AOL honors its promises I&#8217;ll be first to praise it. As ifs go, this is a biggie.</p>

<p><font size=4>Symbian Courts Developers </font></p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/placeholder.png" orig-src="http://209.181.141.40/pictures/ejournal/symbianBooks.jpg" height="172" width="199" border="0" alt="Symbian books: At the Symbian Developers Conference: a stack of books on Symbian applications development."></p>
<p><a href="http://www.symbian.com">Symbian</a> is a partnership of wireless communications giants Ericsson, Matsushita, Motorola and Nokia plus Psion, a company best known for its handheld computers. The company was set up to create an operating-system and development standard for smart mobile devices. In a field where giants like Microsoft want to dominate, and where upstarts like Palm Computing want to have a major role, Symbian is a pre-emptive strike in a nascent market.</p>
<p>As I mentioned yesterday, Symbian is hosting a <a href="http://www.symbiandevnet.com/US2000/USindex.htm">developers conference</a> in Santa Clara this week. Some 700 software developers have registered, the company says.</p>
<p>IBM is one of several major companies to make product and/or service announcements at the conference. IBM plans to work with Symbian to create <a href="http://www.symbian.com/news/2000/pr000215.html">new kinds of wireless applications</a> for use in large enterprises.</p>
<p>I stopped by the convention center this morning to visit with Colly Myers, Symbian&#8217;s chief executive. He was upbeat, naturally, about the platform and its prospects.</p>
<p>Myers dismissed industry scuttlebutt about problems inside the partnership, including the impact widely publicized partnerships between Ericsson and Microsoft, which wants to establish Windows CE as the dominant mobile operating system, and between Motorola and Palm. None of those have any real impact on Symbian, he said, because the phone companies still plan to use Symbian&#8217;s EPOC operating system as the foundation of their advanced devices.</p>
<p>Symbian&#8217;s goal is to have a healthy share &#8212; maybe 15 to 20 percent &#8212; of the &#8220;top end of the handset market,&#8221; Myers said, not to control the whole thing. That&#8217;s still a huge potential market, he notes.</p>
<p>Developers are the key to many kinds of computing platforms. They create the applications and add-ons that attract customers. So the care and feeding of developers is essential. No one does it better than Microsoft, and smart platform companies are copying some of Microsoft&#8217;s tactics in this area, including Symbian, to some degree.</p>
<p>The picture at the top of this commentary shows a new book aimed at Symbian software developers. It&#8217;s a much-needed volume, complementing the <a href="http://www.symbiandevnet.com/downloads/SDk/sdks.html">Software Development Kits</a> available for download at Symbian&#8217;s Web site. Myers says some 24,000 people have signed up on the site as potential developers. That sounds like a lot, but it&#8217;s utterly dwarfed by the legions who are writing applications for Windows and Java.</p>
<p>Java, actually, is part of the Symbian play, because Java is built onto EPOC. Myers says people who use Java to write for other platforms will be able to leverage their work on the Symbian platform. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on a column about development platforms, by the way. If you&#8217;re a developer, I&#8217;d like to hear what you want from platform companies. <span class="email-removed" title="email address removed">E-mail preferred</span>.</p>

				<p>The <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/headline2/009075.htm">Academy Award nominations</a> were announced this morning. &#8220;American Beauty&#8221; is looking deservedly strong.</p>
<p>I suggested an Oscar for hypocrisy in <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg021500.htm">my column today</a>, and gave three examples in the tech industry. Leading the list, of course, was America Online&#8217;s swiftly shifting position on open access for cable data pipes.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>UPDATE: A bit of good news from south Florida, where a federal judge <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,34365,00.html">dismissed most of a cable company lawsuit</a> challenging Broward County&#8217;s open access rules.</p></blockquote>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Phone Company v. ISPs</font></p>
<p>SBC, the regional conglomerate that owns Pacific Bell and other local phone companies, is <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1004-200-1549708.html?tag=st.ne.1002.bgif?st.ne.fd.gif.j">giving away Internet access</a> (Cnet story) to people who sign up for DSL service. For $39 a month you&#8217;ll get DSL service, Internet access, installation and all the hardware. On its face, this sounds great.</p>
<p>Look closer. Can SBC be making money on these prices? Highly doubtful.  Is this a naked attempt by SBC to put its DSL competitors out of business? Highly likely.</p>
<p>SBC is easily the nastiest of the regional monopolies. If you think it&#8217;ll give you such a good deal after it&#8217;s squashed the competition, think again.</p>

<p><font size=4>Symbian Developers Conference in Silicon Valley </font></p>
<p>Microsoft has the PR muscle to dominate the news this week with the launch of Windows 2000, but some of the people who see small devices as the next frontier are in Silicon Valley for the first <a href="http://www.symbiandevnet.com/us2000/usindex.htm">Symbian developers conference</a>. </p>
<p>Symbian is a partnership comprised of major wireless companies and Psion, the handheld computer company based in England. They&#8217;re collaborating on operating systems and other software designed for the wireless data market, with a focus on mobile phones.</p>
<p>Microsoft doesn&#8217;t own the low end of the market. Symbian, which has had a somewhat rocky start, is nonetheless a real player in a growing field.</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s years late, and few consumers will want or need it. But Windows 2000 is a <a href="http://www.sjmercury.com/svtech/news/indepth/docs/ms021400.htm">reasonably significant milestone</a> (Mercury News story) for Microsoft and the computer industry.</p>
<p>First, Windows 2000 is a worthwhile upgrade for people who are running Windows NT today. Or it will be after one or two &#8220;service pack&#8221; releases that fix some of the <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2436920,00.html">more than 63,000 bugs</a> (ZDNet story) in the product being shipped to customers. (The fact that this bug count isn&#8217;t a huge scandal is scandalous in itself.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m running it on one computer at home. There were a few small installation problems, and one unrecognized piece of equipment. It seems stable enough, probably the best feature of all for anything called Windows.</p>
<p>Consumers can <a href="http://www.sjmercury.com/svtech/columns/testdrive/docs/tt021300.htm">pretty much ignore</a> this product for now, says Mike Langberg, computing editor for the Mercury News. I agree.</p>
<hr width=50&#038;>
<p><font size=4>Brill&#8217;s Misguided New Content</font></p>
<p>Like many other people in the journalism business I read and respect <a href="http://www.brillscontent.com/">Brill&#8217;s Content</a>, a magazine that casts a skeptical eye on journalism methods and ethics. We don&#8217;t cover our own business nearly well enough, and the magazine, while often a bit preachy, does a much needed job.</p>
<p>But Steve Brill, the man behind the magazine, has taken his company into a new online venture that <a href="http://ojr.usc.edu/content/story.cfm?request=331">flagrantly breaks the ethical rules</a>, as this story in Online Journalism Review notes. Brill, sadly, seems utterly clueless on his own raging conflict of interest here.</p>

				<p>That&#8217;s the message these days as startups crow about which venture capitalist they&#8217;ve taken money from. It&#8217;s New Marketing in the New Economy, I guess. </p>
<p>I explain more in my <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg021300b.htm">Sunday column</a>. That column is part of the San Jose Mercury News&#8217; quarterly <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com.com/svtech/companies/moneytree/">survey of venture capital</a> in Silicon Valley &#8212; and the numbers you&#8217;ll see there are just mind-boggling.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>AOL&#8217;s Hypocrisy &#8212; Part 8,665</font></p>
<p>When Time Warner agreed recently to be bought by America Online, I questioned the deal on many grounds. One was whether AOL would remain committed to open access for data connections via cable-TV lines. In <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg011100.htm">my column</a> the day after the deal was announced I wrote of AOL and its chief executive, Steve Case:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><i>Case&#8217;s commitment to open standards &#8212; the very basis of the Internet &#8212; is also doubtful. And that&#8217;s a charitable view.</p>
<p>No company has complained louder than AOL about the cable-TV companies&#8217; refusal to open their fast data pipes to competing Internet service providers.  Those complaints have been justified.</p>
<p>Now that AOL will own some large cable-TV systems &#8212; Time Warner is a big operator &#8212; it&#8217;ll have some of the wide-bandwidth access it hasn&#8217;t been able to secure from AT&#038;T and other monopolistic cable operators. Again, Case said all the right things about his continuing commitment to open access. I don&#8217;t trust him to keep his word.</p>
<p>Watch the fine print, and remember history. AOL calls itself an Internet access provider. Yet from its earliest days, AOL&#8217;s strategy has been to support open computing standards, on which the Net is based, only when they would help the company gain customers. Once those customers were signed up, AOL&#8217;s goal was to trap them behind a wall of proprietary technology and content.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Sadly, it looks like I was right to worry. You&#8217;ll see why in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A42393-2000Feb11.html">this story</a> in the Washington Post.</p>
