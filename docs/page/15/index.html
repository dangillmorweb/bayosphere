<p>Just realized I forgot to mention last Sunday&#8217;s Mercury News column. It was about the new <a href="http://www.toyota.com/prius/minisite/index.html">Toyota Prius</a> (note: annoying Flash download) hybrid sedan and why I&#8217;ve been thinking it&#8217;ll be a smash hit.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/dan_gillmor/6713548.htm">Read it here</a>.</p>
<p>Several readers observed that I hadn&#8217;t taken into account the possible high cost of replacing the batteries before the vehicle&#8217;s normal life had expired. Great point, and I plan to look into that question when I get home. If a $3,000 &#8220;repair&#8221; is a mandatory feature at, say, 60,000 miles I won&#8217;t be buying this car after all.

<p>another problem i remember reading about in road &#038; track is that the battery assists when the engine needs more oomph.  for example, hills, accelleration.  but when the battery runs out, that assistance ceases.  the r&#038;t driver was going up a bridge, and decellerated precipitously from 60 to 45 mph when the battery ran out.  sounds a bit dangerous to me.</p>

<p>I would guess that the hybrid version of the Honda Civic would suffer the same problem, though I thought that part of the idea with these cars was that the system was supposed to be charging when assist wasn&#8217;t required.</p>

<p>I like tech and work in the tech biz but I don&#8217;t want a car that&#8217;s all tech.  I like the hybrid idea but certainly don&#8217;t want a video display on my dash board (as this car has).  I&#8217;d prefer simple / reliable analog gauges.<br />Maybe I&#8217;m crazy.</p>

<p>If you buy a Prius, you&#8217;re buying hype.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s horrendously overpriced. A loaded Toyota Corolla S or Nissan Sentra costs only $15,000 &#8211; and they feature more room, comfort, performance, and reliability.</p>
<p>The gasoline savings doesn&#8217;t approach the price difference &#8211; if you drive 12,000 miles per year at 50mpg in a Prius, you use 240 gallons of gasoline. At 35mpg in a Corolla, you use 343 gallons. At $2.30/gallon, the difference is $237/year. There is no discount rate that makes the Prius a better value because of its fuel savings &#8211; even at today&#8217;s temporary high price.  Gasoline would have to go to at least $8/gallon to justify the extra cost of a Prius &#8211; and it won&#8217;t ever reach that price. Higher annual mileage generally doesn&#8217;t affect this conclusion because the Prius freeway mileage advantage is very small.</p>
<p>A Prius battery pack replacement will cost $3000-$5000. Toyota says the batteries will last ten years and guarantees them for eight, but that means that a ten-year-old Prius will be worthless (and consider the environmental impact of that, as well as the environmental issues in processing or disposing of hundreds of pounds of burnt-out batteries!). </p>
<p>In contrast, a ten-year-old Corolla is still excellent transportation &#8211; and worth around $4,000.</p>
<p>Hybrid cars such as the Toyota Prius are a terrible waste of resources and indeed are ticking pollution time bombs.</p>
<p>Suburbanites want to feel like they&#8217;re doing their part to &#8220;save the environment.&#8221; Sorting the trash is harmless, but buying a Prius &#8211; like installing a home photovoltaic system &#8211; is simply wasteful.</p>

<li>AP: <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/6728933.htm">Judge allows Sept. 11 suits against airlines</a>. <i>Opening the door to scores of Sept. 11 lawsuits against the aviation industry, a judge concluded Tuesday that the hijacking and crashing of a jetliner was a &#8220;foreseeable risk.&#8221; U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said negligent security screening might have contributed to the deaths of 3,000 people in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and the crash of a hijacked plane in Pennsylvania.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This is absurd. The terrorists committed an act of war. </p>
<p>If the airlines and the owners of the buildings (also now liable, potentially) aren&#8217;t immune from lawsuits for what happened two years ago tomorrow, then the world truly has gone mad.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a large federal fund for the victims. They deserve sympathy, and they&#8217;re getting unprecedented financial relief from federal taxpayers. Now they want more. Greed will reduce that sympathy factor.</p>
<p>The lawyers? They&#8217;re doing what comes naturally. They&#8217;ll kill what&#8217;s left of American Airlines and United Airlines before this is over. But that&#8217;s the American way, eh?

<p>Dan I think that even if this is a grab for cash that it could prise loose some badly needed facts on the seemingly gross culpable negligence and/or certifiable incompetence involved,not only in the screening processes,(or lack thereof)but the demonstrable break in the command and control of the USA government leading up to this catastrophe.<br />I don&#8217;t think it is for a fistful of dollars,more like lighting a candle in a very dark pit,but I&#8217;ll be watching this case with interest.</p>

<p>Sorry Dan, I have to disagree. This is no way mitigates the the horrible atrocity commited that day but the FAA for years has been sending &#8216;Red Teams&#8217; in to infiltrate airline security and airliners with overwhelming success. Security was a cost to be controlled as closely as possible, not a certifying requirement to continued operation. Millions were spent in DC lobbists to keep security requirements to a minimum and even those modest targets were consistently missed. It doesn&#8217;t happen in Israel because the the Israelis refuse to let their people become hostages or victims or their planes to become missiles. Israelies do not compromise on this.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s really sad because this is the kind of thing which stunts our economy&#8211; we cannot have unlimited liability for this type of stuff, because as much as people like to bash big business, only big business is capable of absorbing the reasonable risks and liabilities and capital costs involved in airline travel (100,000 small mom-and-pop airlines shuttling people around the country in puddle-jumpers is not desireable).</p>
<p>Hijacking attempts are foreseeable, but what the hijackers did was hardly imagineable&#8211; if it had been, mere boxcutters would not have done the job, the passengers could have overpowered a few hijackers, the pilots would never have given up without a fight. Believe me, it will never happen again&#8211; the days of innocence and a recognition of &#8220;honor among thieves&#8221; is gone. They&#8217;re going to have to get a much more substantial weapon aboard to hijack a plane now, something they still would not have been able to get aboard with the &#8216;old&#8217; procedures. So was it negligence? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Who needs enemies when the U.S. is more than capable of driving our own economy into the ground.</p>

<p>The blame lies not exclusively with lawyers and judges (although that&#8217;s where the load-bearing walls are), but also with our currrent societal outlook.  Our dominant societal view is now that virtually all misfortune has its roots in some entity that can be sued.  The Taliban don&#8217;t have enough assets?  Well, then bring down the next contestant.  If you are tired of this sort of thing (and obviously many people are actually envigorated by it) then read The Death of Common Sense by Philip K. Howard.  Or read any of his books.   I&#8217;d put the link, but it looks like I&#8217;m not allowed to put HTML here.</p>

<p>I guess I&#8217;m happier with the airlines catching Hell for their persistent negligence than I was with taxpayers footing the bill.  ON the other hand, perhaps we should draft all the attorneys and give them real weapons to fight our enemies instead of eviscerating people in lawsuits for RIAA, Microsoft and other gentle entities.</p>
<p>Are the government and airlines guilty of lax security standards?  Absolutely&#8230;as the Israelis have shown, relatively minor additional inconvenience and some additional cost can do a much better job.  Unfortunately, as with so many other aspects of life today, this quarter&#8217;s bottom line trumps common sense and future benefits.</p>
<p>Is the government to blame for not anticipating this kind of action&#8230;of course.  Is it to blame for the specific act of violence&#8230;no.  Hindsight gives us a remarkably clear picture of the gems of information buried under a mountain of mud, and it&#8217;s always easy to judge what the NSA, CIA and other security organizations might have been able to do if they had known which data was important in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with an insecure, macho moron in the White House and a culture of secrecy-obsessed, CYA yesmen supporting them, we&#8217;ll probably never learn what happened unless Oliver North makes another movie&#8230;</p>

<p>I went looking at snopes, but found what I was looking for at slate, today&#8217;s slate carries an article about what we don&#8217;t know or have wrong about 9/11: <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2088092/">http://slate.msn.com/id/2088092/</a></p>
<p>Anyway, we don&#8217;t actually know that the planes were hijacked with box cutters alone.  Witnesses reported bombs, chemical sprays, and shooting.</p>
<p>Also, we do know that contrary to Ms. Rice, there were many warnings of precisely this kind of attack</p>
<p>There&#8217;s definitely a flaw in our system that it takes bizarre, incredibly enriching law (oh good, Windows tells me another security hole is ready to be patched) suits to finally give the economic rewards and punishments to get to the bottom of things or to motivate the right behavior.</p>
<p>Because I may be a meany, somehow I would prefer to see corporate officers and government officials going to jail rather than the lawsuit lottery.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m with Dan on this one&#8230;  The blame lies with the  religious fanatics who selected legally permissable items for use as weapons in a surprise terrorist attack that the collective &#8216;intelligence&#8217; capabilities of the free world were unable to predict.</p>
<p>If anyone on this side of the pond should be cast under a spotlight of potential historical culpability, the executive and legislative branches should be nearer the front of the line than United.</p>

<p></span>
<p>2 points:</p>
<p>1. Civil lawsuits are never a good way to get a problem fixed, because they focus on monetary value of damage, and largely work only by apportioning blame to a party when often the interactions are more complex. (Example: toddler choking on candy &#8211; is responsibility the parent&#8217;s or the manufacturer&#8217;s or retailer&#8217;s?)</p>
<p>Having said that&#8230;</p>
<p>2. Airlines have a reasonably unique &#8216;common carrier&#8217; status in that the airline has considerable authority over the passengers, similar to parent:child responsibility. They therefore must have corresponding responsibility, along the lines of &#8216;duty of reasonable care&#8217;. So if an airline has been warned about specific REASONABLY AVOIDABLE risks and then takes no REASONABLE action, then it must be culpable.</p>

<p>I will agree with Dan. I beleive the &#8220;real&#8221; blame lies with our government and the bureaucracy that has evolved in our Intelligence Agencies. Sometimes in speaking of &#8220;Intellegence Agencies&#8221; I begin to feel that is an oxymoron. </p>
<p>The only ones that will see &#8220;funds&#8221; from this type of lawsuit are the lawyers and the courts. I cannot see that in the long run this will do anything but raise the hopes of someone that there will be a large settlement when in reality this type of negligence is not the responsiblity of the airlines but that of the government. This is really a sad situation. </p>
<p>As someone has said, the next round of lawsuits will be against those that built the buildings so tall. They should have known they would be targets of this kind of crime against humanity. </p>
<p>Negligence, as I have been told, is the result of someone who &#8220;knows&#8221; that what they are doing will result in a &#8220;bad&#8221; outcome. I cannot believe that the airlines &#8220;knew&#8221; that 9/11 would happen &#8211; not in their wildest dreams. </p>

<p>Walter,</p>
<p>Negligence is NOT doing something that is known to prevent a bad outcome.</p>
<p>There were a lot of highjackings in the 70&#8217;s, so I think &#8216;not in their wildest dreams&#8217; is a difficult defense.</p>

<p>But the US can&#8217;t have it both ways.  If the US wants to classify the WTC attack was an act of war, then the terrorists are enemy combatants, and due fair treatment under Geneva convention as POWs (which they obviously are not getting).  Specifically, most of them will not be liable for prosecution, inside or outside the US.</p>
<p>So, considering this, you might want to reconsider the WTC attacks as a terrorist act, not an act of war.  In this case, the insurers and, to a lesser extent, the airlines can be sued for recompense.  That, after all, is the way the American justice system works.  I&#8217;d say that if you don&#8217;t like this (the lawsuits), the American justice system needs work.</p>
<p>Specifically, the US needs serious tort reform, and needs to get away from it&#8217;s heavy reliance on the jury system, which results in lawsuits which have no business of even being brought to court, being won.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you agree?</p>

<p> Huh? (see below) &#8220;legally permissable&#8221;?<br />A 4  yr old boy with a Bic disposable shaver could of taken over one of our airplanes for the past 50 years.</p>
<p>Admit it, the USA is (was) a complacent place primarily because of it geography (it wasn&#8217;t bombed like Europe in WW II, or under extreme threats like Israel to actually change protocol.</p>
<p>Watch the movie &#8220;Catch Me if you Can&#8221; and you can see how a con job, while easy to pull off in the &#8217;70s, was still pretty easy to pull off in the recent years too.</p>
<p>How about the Ford Pinto? Let&#8217;s talk about profits and proper safety measures.</p>
<p>As far as the airlines going bankrupt&#8230; well, while competition breeds better service, like it or not, the airlines are the USA&#8217;s public transit system, and it&#8217;s understandable they are always rescued by the US Govt. They might as well be the Post Office.</p>

<p>Wow this is all crazy!! Today I saw this headline:</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG(DBKGn) is seeking to hold New  York State liable for more than $500 million due to property damage done to its building following the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center.</p>
<p>They are suing the NY tax payer to recover the cost of water damage and stolen computers and lost business which were the effects of Sept 11. Well I guess social services, fire, police, teachers, and all the other programs will have to take a huge cut if this German bank prevails. Has everyone gone mad in NYC in the sue happy capital?? Wow, there will be enormous transfers of wealth from the average hard working New Yorker to the pockets of big lawyers and the rich after this.</p>
<p>The little guy get screwed again.</p>

<p>Jay point that this was not an &#8220;act of war&#8221; is worth repeating,<br />and worth expanding.</p>
<p>The simple truth is that there is no &#8220;war on terrorism&#8221;:  we&#8217;re<br />no more &#8220;at war with&#8221; al Qaida,  or terrorists in general,  than <br />we were &#8220;at war with&#8221; Jesse James,  Pancho Villa,  Al Capone,  or <br />Timothy McVeigh.  Osama &#038; Company are just another gang of<br />thugs,  who happen to have motives and methods that are <br />somewhat different from the thugs we&#8217;re more familiar with.</p>
<p>If you doubt that the &#8220;war on terrorism&#8221; is a sham,  simply<br />examine the way the Bushies &#8220;wage&#8221; it and use it:  when it&#8217;s<br />inconvenient for them to stay within the bounds of U.S. law and<br />our Constitution,  we&#8217;re suddenly &#8220;at war&#8221;,  with an urgent<br />need for executive powers that give fascists wet dreams.  When<br />it&#8217;s inconvenient to be bound by the laws of war,  we<br />magically transform into some sort of &#8220;megacop&#8221;,  who&#8217;s<br />rounding up crooks who aren&#8217;t &#8220;real&#8221; combatants.</p>
<p>But,  while I disagree strongly with Dan&#8217;s characterization of<br />the acts,  he&#8217;s right about the liability:  the airlines<br />should be no m<br />
ore &#8220;accountable&#8221; for the acts of the thugs<br />who stole their planes than the Ryder people should be for<br />the tragedies resulting from the bombing of the Murrah Building.</p>

<p>Ran Talbott,</p>
<p>Amen to those words. The attack, because it wasn&#8217;t a government action, but a group made up of civilians located around the world, it is a major crime to be dealt with by the FBI not the military. But Bush has decided to use both heavy handedly. </p>
<p>Also I was thinking, under the logic of that judge if my car was stolen (which is what the terrorists did with the planes) from my driveway and then packed with explosives and used to blow up a school (something al Qaida would probably like to do) it would be my fault as well and I would be financially responsible for the disaster. Crazy!</p>

Natch, one of those is about weblogs.</p>
<p>The picture above is of the famous Table Mountain, towering over Cape Town. The bay is beautiful, but the mountain is <b>the</b> landmark here.</p>
<p>Some clouds came in late in the day, creating this ethereal scene:</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t been in Africa for precisely two years. In 2001 I joined a group of journalists sponsored by the Freedom Forum, giving workshops and speaking at the same conference that year. The day we left Grahamstown, site of the conference, we were driving in a van toward the Port Elizabeth Airport when a mobile phone rang. We were informed that an airplane had just crashed into the World Trade Center. The date was Sept. 11, and the rest of that trip became a blur.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to be back, under different circumstances.

<p>Hi, Dan.</p>
<p>Have you met Garrett Gruener, Democratic candidate for governor yet? Check out his stand on Prop 13; you may find him right up your alley. Prop 13 is discussed in his budget, blog and elsewhere on the site. www.gruenerforgovernor.com</p>
<p>Gruener is a seasoned venture capitalist and the founder of several companies including Ask Jeeves. He is also a well-known philanthropist in the Bay Area and has served on the boards of several non-profit organizations that focus on teaching youth through the arts and sciences. </p>
<p>Gruener grew up in San Diego and has spent most of his life in California. He attended U.C. San Diego, where he received a bachelor&#8217;s degree in political science in 1976 and U.C. Berkeley, where he received a master&#8217;s degree, also in political science, in 1977. He lives with his wife and daughter in Oakland, Calif. </p>

<p>This is incredibly sloppy,  Dan.</p>
<p>1. Only a third (15 of 43) of the companies involved <br />have actually settled with FERC (or,  in some cases,<br />been exonerated).</p>
<p>2. According to a Reuters report published on the WBUR website<br />(do a google news search for &#8220;ferc california settlement&#8221;,<br />and you&#8217;ll probably find it in several places),  two of<br />those 15 companies settled for over $800,000 each,<br />so the &#8220;$1 million&#8221; dollar figure is clearly bogus.<br />And at least one of those (Reliant) was cleared of<br />allegations it had been gaming the system:  their<br />fine was for another form of hanky-panky.</p>
<p>3. FERC isn&#8217;t supposed to suck up all the ill-gotten gains <br />as fines:  those are *criminal* penalties,  and the recovery<br />of the money we were swindled out of is a completely<br />separate *civil* case.</p>
<p>And the discussion of mp3.com is even worse:  they<br />didn&#8217;t invent any &#8220;new technology&#8221;.  What they &#8220;invented&#8221;<br />was a new legal doctrine of &#8220;space shifting&#8221;,  and<br />proceeded to build a business around it.  Despite warnings<br />from lawyers that it wasn&#8217;t going to fly in court.</p>
<p>As we know,  it didn&#8217;t.  And,  when the dust settled,<br />Robertson (whose hare-brained notion sank the company)<br />walked away about $250 million dollars richer,  while<br />the people who bought and held stock at the IPO wound up <br />losing about 80% of their investment.</p>
<p>There may be an example of &#8220;stealing legally&#8221; here,  but.<br />if there is,  it&#8217;s not the energy companies (who haven&#8217;t<br />finished with the legal system yet).</p>

<p>I am new to the internet and I am surfing here and this is very interesting reading. I did a search in the search engines on &#8220;company blog&#8221; and I found your web blog.<br />I am a Lawyer in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada and thus my interest in searching for a company blog on the WWW.<br />I just wanted to see how the rest of the world thinks and see what trends and technology are happening in the world. I also was interested in a blog for myself which might possibly lead to a blob for my law firm, you never know, that is if I can understand the technology of operating a blog and from what you are discussing I am somewhat hesitant right now.<br />The different things discussed on a website found by searching for &#8220;company blog&#8221; in the search engine is very amusing reading to this Halifax Lawyer.</p>

Carl McCall, said the approval of Grasso&#8217;s $140 million pay package &#8220;raises serious questions regarding the effectiveness of the NYSE&#8217;s current governance structure.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>No kidding, but Donaldson is being low key here. </p>
<p>This outlandish loot for the head of the New York Stock Exchange doesn&#8217;t raise questions. I shouts of continued, unrepentant arrogance in the top ranks of America&#8217;s business community.</p>
<p>One interesting question in the SEC letter is the extent to which Grasso&#8217;s winnings will come from money the NYSE would otherwise use for genuine enforcement of rules designed to protect shareholders. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen plenty of evidence that the NYSE &#8212; and other stock exchanges &#8212; did far too little enforcement while the bubble expanded. Yet now that times have gotten grim from shareholders, CEOs and other top executives are doing just fine, thanks, and there&#8217;s another corporate scandal every week.</p>
<p>If Donaldson is really going after these folks &#8212; really trying to clean up Wall Street, which is plainly incapable of self-correction &#8212; he&#8217;ll deserve great applause. He&#8217;ll be helping to save capitalism, something today&#8217;s corporate chieftains don&#8217;t worry about.

<p>I read an article about this earlier this month in the NYTs. The big problem that all of the high-paid executives had that were interviewed for the article was that the money comes at no risk. It&#8217;s not like stock options where at least there is some pretense of &#8220;earning&#8221; the money&#8230; it&#8217;s all in cash.</p>

<p>The States (like NY and Oklahoma) have been embarrassing the Feds for well over a year now. Its pathetic that Spitzer&#8217;s 12 man office is out-ivestigating, out-enforceing and out-settling the SEC&#8217;s much larger but still undersized staff.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;ve addressed this issue alot; See link)</p>
<p>Credit new SEC chairman Donaldson for finally finding an issue that the states haven&#8217;t beat him to. Of course, I imagine that he&#8217;s a little pissed, having had Grasso&#8217;s job 8 years ago &#8212; and not reciveing anywhere near that kind of coin . . . </p>

But they won&#8217;t be very big,  or<br />at all effective:   the sad truth is that most Americans<br />view the debate over the Patriot Act as &#8220;a bunch of<br />pointy-headed liberals yammering about the treatment of<br />a bunch of towel-headed terrorists&#8221;.  They don&#8217;t see it<br />as having anything to do with them,  or anyone or anything<br />they care about.</p>
<p>I see very little hope of the situation improving anytime<br />soon:  Americans have sacrificed every principle we<br />ever stood for in the name of the &#8220;war&#8221; on terrorism.<br />We&#8217;ve thrown away our beliefs in the rule of law,  in<br />the fundamental rights of the individual,  and in national <br />sovereignty.  We&#8217;ve killed more innocent people than<br />al Qaida,  accepted the same practices of torture we&#8217;ve<br />condemned other countries for (sometimes even using some<br />of those same states as our agents to distance ourselves<br />from the practice),  and set up our own Star Chamber system of<br />secret trials and punishments of individuals who don&#8217;t<br />even have to be identified to the people in whose name<br />they&#8217;re being imprisoned (and possibly even executed).<br />And the Bushies are hinting that we&#8217;re just getting warmed up.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin once said that those who sacrifice<br />essential liberty for a little security deserve neither,<br />but we haven&#8217;t even gotten any security in exchange.</p>
<p>If Bush &#038; Co. ever do succeed at establishing a <br />national religion,  our first order of business should<br />be a National Day of Prayer that we don&#8217;t get what we<br />deserve&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard an american journalist on TV5 (french edition) who told that if a major attack would happen on US ground, USA wouldn&#8217;t be a democracy no more.<br />I hope he&#8217;s wrong but my mind tells me he isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The terrorists would achieve their goals if it comes that way.</p>

<p>Dave Winer has <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/tipsForCandidatesReWeblogs">suggestions for political candidates</a> on how to use weblogs. A key insight is that pointing at other candidates&#8217; sites should be part of the process: <i>&#8220;You don&#8217;t get anywhere by preaching only to the choir (but you have to do that too).&#8221;</i>

<p>Sounds like an opportunity to bring a whole new layer to political slamming by recognizing some candidates and not others. I can see it now&#8230;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s entertaining to watch as David Weinberger <a href="http://hyperorg.com/blogger/">blogs away</a> on the Dean campaign trail for a few days. Keeping in mind that he&#8217;s a strong supporter of Dean, you&#8217;ll learn a few things. I keep waiting for other campaigns to figure this out&#8230;</p>
<p>BTW, here&#8217;s a piece I wrote for Computerworld on <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/managementtopics/management/story/0,10801,84238,00.html">what corporate information-technology folks can learn</a> from the Dean style.
