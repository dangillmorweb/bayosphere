				<p>It&#8217;s been snowing steadily for more than 24 hours as I write this. Bill Clinton is long gone from the World Economic Forum&#8217;s annual meeting, and while the Davos streets are still busy the intensity level has diminished somewhat.</p>
<p>One reason is that Sunday at Davos is the closest thing to a day of rest. The official doings didn&#8217;t get started until mid-afternoon, when the U.S. secretaries of state and treasury took to the stage to give their views of things. As expected, both were mostly upbeat.</p>
<p>In the halls of the Congress Centre, people are huddling. It&#8217;s one of the rituals of meetings of this sort &#8212; the schmooze effect that is so essential. When such top-level people get together for an event of this sort, part of their motivation is to be with others like themselves, in a place where they can have impromptu meetings.</p>
<p>As Paul Saffo puts it, &#8220;Nothing propinquits like proprinquity.&#8221; I explain what that means in my <a href="">Sunday column</a> in the Mercury News.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>More on DoubleClick</font></p>
<p>Richard Smith, who has done more to expose online security holes and highlight privacy violations than anyone I know, sends this follow-up on the DoubleClick situation.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>Saw your article on DoubleClick and enjoyed it a lot.</p>
<p>Here is another one for you.  Lycos has allowed DoubleClick to bug their search results page.  Near the bottom of a results page, you can find 1-by-1 GIF file that goes back to DoubleClick. Here is what one of these bugs look like <i>(Note from Dan: I&#8217;ve removed the &lt; and > tags at the beginning and end of this so you&#8217;ll be able to see the code on this Web page.) </i>:</p>
<p>IMG SRC=&quot;<a href=&quot;http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/ly.ln/r&quot;>http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/ly.ln/r</a>;kw=sports+cars;<br />  cat=;sz=468&#215;60;ord=8001195465?&quot;  WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=1 BORDER=0</p>
<p>You can also see that Lycos is passing off people&#8217;s search strings in the &#8220;kw&#8221; parameter of the URL query string to DoubleClick.  Looks to me DoubleClick is profiling Lycos users, but Lycos has never bothered to tell anyone.</p>
<p>I first found these Web bugs about 3 months ago.  I asked Lycos what was going on, but never got an answer.</p>
<p>From other news reports, my understand is that banner ads at Lycos are provided exclusively by Engage and not DoubleClick.  So these bugs are not related to advertising.</p>
<p>Similar Web Bugs are also being put on DirectHit search result pages.</p>
<p>You might also want to include a link to my <a href="http://www.tiac.net/users/smiths/privacy/wbfaq.htm">Web Bug FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>It explains how Web Bugs (AKA, clear GIFs, tracker GIFs) work and what they are used for. </p>

<p>Before President Clinton spoke at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, today, the audience in the big meeting hall was asked to leave while a security sweep was done of the room. Many of the corporate and government poo-bahs gathered here flat-out refused. They ended up getting their way.</p>
<p>Here are <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/premium/world/docs/davos30.htm">some details</a>, in a special Sunday column in the San Jose Mercury News.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>DoubleClick&#8217;s Opt-Out Not Working?</font></p>
<p>In this column earlier this week, I <a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/2000/01/26">told you how how</a> to opt out of DoubleClick&#8217;s Web surveillance system.  It may be just a  coincidence, but readers have reported (and my experience seems to verify) that you can no longer opt out, at least for the time being. Instead they got a login dialog box for clients. </p>
<p>I have trouble believing the company could be so stupid as to do this deliberately to thwart opt-outers, but the timing sure is interesting.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>UPDATE:</p>
<p>It now appears that the DoubleClick opt-out system is working again. I just gave it a try, using the <a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/2000/01/26">longer method</a> described in this column, where you go through DoubleClick&#8217;s fairly tedious process. </p></blockquote>

<p>The banner on the Davos building could hardly be more arrogant: a McDonald&#8217;s sign that says, &#8220;Think Global, Eat Local!&#8221; It almost defines the angst that some people feel when they look at the world&#8217;s cultural and economic globalization.</p>
<p>Yet there it is, smirking in its yellow glory.</p>
<p>Davos, as the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum is generally known, is a gathering of the globe&#8217;s rich and powerful. They come to hear world political and business leaders &#8212; Tony Blair today, Bill Clinton tomorrow, Bill Gates on Monday &#8212; and to schmooze together in all their glory.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/placeholder.png" orig-src="http://209.181.141.40/pictures/ejournal/tonyBlair.jpg" height="162" width="259" border="0" alt="Tony Blair: "></p>
<p>Blair&#8217;s speech was more of his usual &#8220;Third Way&#8221; kind of material &#8212; the reasonable notion of pulling elements from the political Left, adding some from the Right, recognizing the nature of today&#8217;s change and creating a socio-political-economic argument for a new way of looking at the world&#8217;s problems. He&#8217;ll probably go home happy this weekend, because the speech was well received. But he certainly didn&#8217;t say anything new, not that anyone expected startling stuff &#8212; any more than they expect shocking material from Clinton tomorrow.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a strong technology tinge to this meeting. Silicon Valley is represented in keeping with its growing economic clout, both in the audience and on panels. I suspect some of them are missing a key point of Davos &#8212; the intellectual piece, not just the schoooze-a-thon portion &#8212; but single-mindedness is part of what made the valley what it is today.</p>
<p>One technology luminary told me, &#8220;If I haven&#8217;t met 500 people by the time I leave, I haven&#8217;t done my job.&#8221; </p>
<p>Yet I spotted that same executive, Sun Microsystem&#8217; John Gage, in a session run by Benjamin Zander, a classical musician and conductor from Boston. By the end of the two hours Zander had the audience singing from Beethoven&#8217;s 9th Symphony &#8212; in German. The topic of the session, by the way, was leadership.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a picture of Zander. He was a lot clearer than this picture&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/placeholder.png" orig-src="http://209.181.141.40/pictures/ejournal/benjaminZander.jpg" height="221" width="125" border="0" alt="Benjamin Zander: "></p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Inequality Gap, So It Goes</font></p>
<p>Price Waterhouse Cooper&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pwcdavos.com/ceosurvey/overview.htm">annual CEO survey</a>, released at Davos yesterday, has no major surprises. Chief executives are optimistic. They see the income and wealth gaps growing, not shrinking. </p>

<p>The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, better known as Davos, after the Alpine village where it&#8217;s held each winter, is under way. The panel discussions are off the record, though much of what&#8217;s said seems to find its way onto the record within hours.</p>
<p>One participant in an economic session told me afterwards &#8212; this makes it on the record &#8212; that the Japanese economy got a lot of attention, mostly unfavorable. The feeling among many was that the Japanese government&#8217;s efforts to solve economic woes has been insufficient, largely because undone structural changes are needed much more than the largely cosmetic ones achieved to date.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/placeholder.png" orig-src="http://209.181.141.40/pictures/ejournal/davosPanel.jpg" height="240" width="320" border="0" alt="Davos Panel: Davos panel"></p>
<p>Some of the early buzz, at least among journalists, relates to a tough piece on Page One of this morning&#8217;s European Wall Street Journal. The story is about the man who founded the organization, Klaus Schwab, and his for-profit business dealings, which on occasion have had some connection with the non-profit forum. The harried look on the faces of staff members may be more than just the overall craziness in putting on such a major event.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>USA Today says DoubleClick, the company that tracks your moves on the Web, has (ahem)<a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/061582.htm">  reconsidered its promise</a> not to connect individual browsers with names and addresses. It&#8217;s a good story, but unfortunately this isn&#8217;t exactly a surprise. I&#8217;ll be more shocked when an online company proves it can be trusted with customers&#8217; data.</p>
<p>DoubleClick&#8217;s threat to consumer privacy has long been obvious. In fact, the company&#8217;s CEO, Kevin O&#8217;Connor, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/110496/5811342a.htm"> told Forbes magazine</a> in 1996 (the quote is at the end of the story) that any connecting of DoubleClick&#8217;s database to names, addressess and the like &#8220;would be voluntary on the user&#8217;s part, and used in strict confidence. We are not going to trick people or match information from other sources.&#8221;    </p>
<p>Then, last year, DoubleClick bought Abacus Direct Corp., a direct-marketing services company &#8212; for precisely the purpose O&#8217;Connor disclaimed. And as USA Today makes clear, the company and its online partners are already doing this without notifying customers. </p>
<p>Okay, you&#8217;re theoretically being notified &#8212; many levels down in some Web sites, hidden in fine print that is so tedious you suspect it&#8217;s designed not to be read. If that&#8217;s adequate notification, I&#8217;m Steve Forbes (the only major-party presidential candidate, by the way, who appears to recognize privacy as a campaign issue).</p>
<p>This latest outrage raises a question: Is anyone awake at the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">Federal Trade Commission</a>? Apparently not.</p>
<p>DoubleClick says you can opt out &#8212; that is, put your information in a database that keeps you from being tracked. Two problems: First, you need to do it with every browser on every computer you use. Second, as we&#8217;ve seen, DoubleClick has shown it can&#8217;t be trusted to keep its word.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/cgi-bin3/optout/check2.pl">Click here</a> to take yourself out of DoubleClick&#8217;s database, just in case you think it&#8217;s worth the trouble. </p>
<p>Or, do it the long way, as if you were trying to get to the opt-out part of DoubleClick&#8217;s Web site. (Note: This is a multi-step process &#8212; possibly designed to make you give up midway.) </p>
<p>
<li>Go to DoubleClick&#8217;s <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com">home page</a>.
<li>Click on &#8220;Privacy Policy&#8221; on the left side of the page (you may have to scroll down to see it). Read the horse manure statement and then go back to the top of the page.
<li>On the left you&#8217;ll see, under &#8220;Privacy Policy,&#8221; a link called &#8220;Privacy &#038; Opt Out.&#8221; Click on that. Here, DoubleClick tries to persuade you that it and its partners are spying on your Web movements solely for your own good.
<li>Scroll down to the link that says &#8220;If you would still like to Opt-Out, please click here.&#8221; Click there, and DoubleClick returns a message that you&#8217;ve opted out.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you feel better, now?</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Opting Out of Other Spy Sites</font></p>
<p>The Center for Democracy &#038; Technology has an <a href="http://opt-out.cdt.org/">opt-out page</a> covering several kinds of direct marketing. Use it. Or lose even more of your privacy.</p>

</p>
<p>Still think Microsoft should face no conduct remedies for its anticompetitive conduct?

<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>A Question of Trust</font>
</p>
<p>The head of a self-described Internet fraud protection company in southern California <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/023206.htm">has resigned</a> (AP) after it emerged that he&#8217;d falsified his past in any number of ways. A felony conviction, for instance.
</p>
<p>This guy was foolish in more ways than one. He went on TV in a matter unrelated to his company, following which people who knew of his past let the local media know, too. Boom, he&#8217;s gone.
</p>
<p>But in the wake of the <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/indepth/docs/oracle062900.htm">Oracle-Microsoft snooping flap</a> this week, a reader wrote a letter I&#8217;m finding difficult to answer. Here&#8217;s an excerpt:<br />
<blockquote><i>I&#8217;m a semi-retired former corporate manager. I am pro-free enterprise to the <br />max.
</p>
<p>Who the Hell can I trust anymore?
</p>
<p>I read the stories about Ellison&#8217;s &#8220;scandalous&#8221; conduct.
</p>
<p>I know that MSFT has hired top public affairs talent to spin stories their <br />way.
</p>
<p>Should I believe the (stock) analyst who shot (a high-profile Internet company) out of the <br />sky? Maybe the guy is bought and paid for by a competitor. Who&#8217;s watching the <br />analysts. I see the NYSE just fined an analyst&#8217;s employer for the analyst&#8217;s <br />false tips. That&#8217;s a first.
</p>
<p>The Motley Fool, which I love, preaches that I must do my own research on <br />investments. This I accept.
</p>
<p>But how do I do that today? Who can I trust?</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Who, indeed?
</p>
<p>I find it astonishing, for example, that anyone believes <i>anything</i> posted on stock-trading chat or bulletin boards, where the pump-and-dump con artists prey on the genuine fools who buy or sell based on nothing but sheer rumor.
</p>
<p>How do we approach the question of trust today, in a world where companies with money can launder their propaganda through supposedly independent third party groups?  Should we assume what we read and hear is false until proved true? Barring more solid disclosure of conflicts of interest, perhaps we should.

<p><font size=4>Loudcloud Likes Microsoft &#8212; Oh, the Irony</font>
</p>
<p>Marc Andreessen has been at the lead of one major movement as co-founder of Netscape, which lost out to Microsoft for a complicated set of reasons. His notes were among the key exhibits at the antitrust trial. He has no reason to like Microsoft.

<p>Network Solutions Inc. continues to exercise &#8212; many say abuse &#8212; its power as the dominant domain-name registry. Now it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,37191,00.html">commandeering elapsed domain names</a> (Wired News) and planning to put them up for auction.
</p>
<p>No other company in the domain registry business comes close to the power and arrogance of NSI. Now under the wing of Verisign, NSI, which can&#8217;t seem to prevent rampant domain highjackings due to its inefficient security measures, seems more interested in leveraging its original monopoly into something much bigger. This should frighten not just competing registrars but all of us. When will it stop?
