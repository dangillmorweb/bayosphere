				<p>Microsoft has given out several different versions of the hacking attack it suffered recently. The truth is getting &#8212; as so often happens with Microsoft &#8212; impossible to discern.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/14306.html">The Register</a> has one of the better stories on this situation. But the questions are still out there, and Microsoft has not begun to answer them in a way that will satisfy anyone who wants to believe, however forlornly, that the world&#8217;s largest, richest and most powerful software company has even half a clue about security.</p>
<p>Microsoft has never seemed to give much of a hoot about security. Features and maintaining the monopoly have always mattered more than the safety of customers&#8217; data. Chickens come home to roost, even in Redmond.</p>

				<p>We have, on balance a free press in the United States. Many other parts of the world can&#8217;t say that, and an organization in Prague is doing something about it.</p>
<p>More in my <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg102900.htm">Sunday column</a>.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4> Technology and Human Beings </font> </p>
<p><img src="http://static2.userland.com/pictures/ejournal/camdenopera.jpg" height="240" width="320" border="0" alt="CamdenOperaHouse: ">&lt; br></p>
<p>Technology&#8217;s soul is most apparent by its absence. Silicon Valley remains disturbingly preoccupied with money and velocity, the binary values of  today&#8217;s tech culture.</p>
<p>Not here, not in Camden, Maine. Not this weekend, anyway.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been participating in a conference like few others. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.poptech.org">Pop!Tech</a>, and it is a reaffirmation of the values that matter most in a world where soulless technology has come to play such a dominant role.</p>
<p>The subtitle of Pop!Tech, which took place at the beautifully restored Camden Opera House (pictured above, with MIT&#8217;s Rodney Brooks speaking), was &#8220;Being Human in the Digital Age&#8221; &#8212; an apt theme. At this gathering, technologists, educators, artists, politicians and others contemplated what really matters in this New Economy equation. People.</p>
<p>&#8220;How does it really affect the bottom line of your life?&#8221; asked Mike Hawley, a professor a the MIT Media Lab.</p>
<p>And how does it affect other people&#8217;s lives? </p>
<p>Each session seemed more interesting than the one before. Wonderful sparks flew when the governor of Maine, Angus King, sat on a panel with Whit Diffie, inventor of public-key encryption, and the American Civil Liberties Union&#8217;s Ira Glasser. King sounds libertarian, but is authoritarian when the mood strikes &#8212; he&#8217;s a big advocate of fingerprinting Maine&#8217;s schoolteachers.</p>
<p>I was struck by the number of speakers who talked about human values, the ones that truly matter. I wonder if the technologists present really heard what they were being told.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume technology is morally neutral, said Rushworth Kidder, founder and president of the Institute for Global Ethics, based here in Maine. &#8220;I&#8217;ll grant that it is,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you&#8217;ll grant to me that human beings engaged in technology are part of a moral community and they must make moral choices in the face of astonishing change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overall, the human race is becoming more ethical, Kidder said. But is the pace of ethical improvement keeping pace with Moore&#8217;s Law? No. Witness the ability of a single individual at a keyboard to create damage on a level once reserved to nation-states.</p>
<p>&#8220;We may be better than our ancestors, but that may not be good enough,&#8221; Kidder said.</p>
<p>Questions of right and wrong are easy. It&#8217;s the conflicts between right and right &#8212; when each choice can be justified as meeting some value &#8212; that are the difficult ones, Kidder said.</p>
<p><img src="http://static2.userland.com/pictures/ejournal/metcalfesuclley.jpg" height="234" width="186" border="0" alt="MetcalfeAndSculley: "><br />Above are the principal hosts of the conference, Bob Metcalfe and John Sculley, as they served locally made ice cream during a Saturday afternoon break.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be writing more about the conference, but not until much later today.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.nsi.com">Network Solutions</a>, the monopolistic domain-name registrar and database holder now owned by VeriSign, has been keeping expired domain names off the market with the apparent intention of auctioning them off, according to critics. </p>
<p>The situation has attracted a <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/intweek/stories/news/0,4164,2644260,00.html">lawsuit alleging illegal hoarding</a>. </p>
<p>Network Solutions denies it&#8217;s doing anything of the sort. &#8220;We delete names as they expire&#8221; from the central database, says Doug Wolford, NSI&#8217;s group general manager of Web presence services.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what happens in this case. Someone&#8217;s not telling the truth.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>A Privacy Fraud</font> </p>
<p>Congress seems poised to pass a so-called &#8220;privacy bill&#8221; that prohibits the sale of Social Security numbers &#8212; except that the legislation is so ridden with loopholes that it actually makes the problem worse.</p>
<p>As the Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7249-2000Oct24.html">reported yesterday</a>, &#8220;One exception also would permit state and local governments to continue selling records containing Social Security numbers. The provision is worded in such a way that, critics say, it would allow businesses buying those records to use Social Security numbers with no legal restraints.&#8221;</p>
<p>This fraudulent reform is apparently being pulled off at the behest of the Individual Reference Services Group, made up of big marketers. These people are defending to the death their right to buy and sell your most personal information &#8212; and to deny you the right to have any authority to tell them to stop.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Meanwhile at the Justice Department&#8230;</font> </p>
<p>Wall Street Journal: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/481448.asp">Computer-crime treaty evokes criticism from U.S. tech firms</a>. <i>Another provision outlaws possession, in some circumstances, of network-security tools that experts typically use to diagnose computer systems; authorities fear those tools could be used by hackers. The treaty also would require citizens to disclose passwords or unscrambling keys to unlock data police seize in criminal cases.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Clinton administration&#8217;s outright hostility to civil liberties is on display again. These folks will do anything and go anywhere to defeat your rights in the name of security.</p>
<p>Not that a Republican administration would be much better&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>On the Road</font> </p>
<p>I&#8217;m heading to Maine for the <a href="http://www.poptech.org">Pop!Tect conference</a>, subtitled &#8220;Being Human in the Digital Age&#8221; &#8212; a fascinating gathering of technology and the humanities. I&#8217;ll be moderating a panel with MIT&#8217;s Pattie Maes and author Ellen Ullman. Stay tuned for reports.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ll be voting sometime during the next week, having retrieved my absentee ballot yesterday at the Registrar of Voters&#8217; office in San Jose. I take the franchise seriously. You should, too. End of civic sermon.</p>
<p>The polls show Dianne Feinstein leading her Republican challenger, Tom Campbell, in the race for Senate. People apparently like the incumbent&#8217;s views on a lot of issues.</p>
<p>But when it comes to technology this one is no contest. Cambell understands the issues. Feinstein plainly does not.</p>
<p>The difference is most apparent when you look at the two candidates&#8217; Web sites. Cambell discusses several key technology issues on <a href="http://www.campbell.org/">his site</a> with clarity and, even if you don&#8217;t agree with what he says, apparent conviction. <a href="http://www.diannefeinstein.org/">Feinstein&#8217;s site</a>, conversely, barely mentions technology.</p>
<p>The incumbent, moreover, has been actively hostile on issues that people who care about technology consider important. She&#8217;s repeatedly indicated her willingness to suspend fundamental civil liberties in pursuit of speech on the Internet if she dislikes that speech &#8212; an astonishing position for any politician who claims to understand why we have a Bill of Rights. She&#8217;s supported restrictive encryption policies. Campbell has been much more sensible. </p>
<p>Campbell also spoke out on one of the key issues of the past few years when he voices support for the antitrust suit against Microsoft. I don&#8217;t recall Feinstein ever opening her mouth on this.</p>
<p>There are other reasons to consider Campbell. He&#8217;s a voice of reason on the failed drug war, urging treatment instead of filling jails with drug users. Feinstein is for more and more and more of the same old stuff &#8212; a drug war that does more to corrupt and harm our society than we seem to understand.</p>
<p>An interesting race.</p>

				<p>Sorry for the absence yesterday. We had a severe problem with our Internet connection, and by the time it came back up I had to head out to give several talks.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Gore, and What&#8217;s Right</font> </p>
<p>After the third presidential debate &#8212; or joint appearance, as Dan Rather puts it more accurately &#8212; Al Gore was interviewed by CNN. The reporter noted that Gore had repeatedly broken the rules, which both sides had agreed to follow, by directly addressing Bush and the audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; Gore said, adding that he wanted to make his points and, in effect, would pretty much do as he pleased.</p>
<p>From my viewpoint, the rules were stupid. Gore and Bush should have allowed direct questioning of each other and the ability to follow up an audience member&#8217;s question for clarity (or whatever).</p>
<p>But Gore&#8217;s flippant view of rules was more than disturbing. It was a bit scary.</p>
<p>This is a man who believes the rules are only for other people. Is this what we want in a president?</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Proposition 39</font> </p>
<p>California voters are facing a pivotal vote on whether we care enough about our kids&#8217; education to pay for it. This is Proposition 39, which has won the endorsement of an array of technology leaders.</p>
<p>More in <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg101800.htm">this column</a>.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Talking about Money </font> </p>
<p>Dave Winer: <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney">Transcendental Money</a>. <i>Transcendental money is the amount of money required to transcend time. It makes just enough money to satisfy all your reasonable needs, wants and desires, but no more. </i></p>

<p><font size=4>Dot-com Confidence, and a Hard Look</font> </p>
<p>Or maybe the word should be &#8220;arrogance&#8221; &#8212; because even in the wake of the current market debacle and the real-world return to rationality, the dot-com executives here at the <a href="https://conference.dasar.com/oq/products.nsf">European Technology Roundtable Exhibition</a> managed to pretend they weren&#8217;t all that concerned. Good acting, I guess.</p>
<p>I had a useful chat with Paul Deninger, the chairman and CEO of <a href="http://www.broadview.com">Broadview</a>, a mergers-and-acqusitions advisor focusing on information technology. He&#8217;s been outspoken for at least a year now about the ugly charade that has played out in the tech marketplace.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, investment bankers and brokerages managed to shift almost all risk into the public markets by taking companies public ridiculously soon, often businesses that operated on a wing and a prayer, not any serious fundamental value. The people with the least information and the most to lose &#8212; average folks who bought into the hype and wanted into that &#8220;Internet stock thing&#8221; &#8212; were the suckers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Small investors are all at a disadvantage,&#8221; he says in a classic understatement.</p>
<p>But Deninger has a theory that the day traders, also among the biggest losers in the recent downturn, share the blame. Through profound ignorance of fundamentals, they created markets for companies that had unsustainable  business models. </p>
<p>When companies needed secondary financing, the day traders were&#8217;t around, and helped create a double-whammy against survival. </p>
<p>&#8220;Day traders don&#8217;t own,&#8221; Deniger points out. &#8220;They trade.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of them lose, too. It&#8217;s a shame if they&#8217;re dragging everyone down with them.</p>

				<p><img src="http://static2.userland.com/pictures/ejournal/geoff1.jpg" height="240" width="320" border="0" alt="GeoffGoodfellow: Geoff Goodfellow at Prague's Charles Bridge"><br />Meet Geoff Goodfellow, who may be the world&#8217;s happiest refugee from Silicon Valley. He moved here to Prague two years ago, and he&#8217;s convinced he landed in heaven.</p>
<p>Goodfellow had a long track record in Silicon Valley and the technology business, including a stint at SRI and as the founder of a company called Radiomail, a wireless communications service. He left the company in 1996 after disputes with investors. It was on a subsequent visit to Prague that he decided this was the place he should stay.</p>
<p>He arrived with a nest egg from selling a loft in San Francisco, plus savings. It wasn&#8217;t all that much in the hyper-attenuated Bay Area market, but it was a king&#8217;s ransom here. He rented a loft from which he can see the imposing, world-famous Prague Castle, made friends, began trading stocks using the Internet for research, indulged his passion for good food and being a music DJ &#8212; and settled into a life he visibly loves.</p>
<p>In the picture above, Goodfellow is almost literally in the shadow of the famed Charles Bridge. He&#8217;s at one of his favorite local restaurants, Kampa Park. The chef, Alex Freij, a native New Yorker, worked at San Francisco&#8217;s famed Aqua restaurant for several years, and the food shows it. The seared yellowfin tuna is amazing.</p>
<p>Goodfellow, still somewhat bitter about his experiences with venture capitalists and investors at Radiomail, is moving back into the technology business in a small way. He wants to start an Internet radio station featuring the kind of music he plays as a DJ &#8212; a variety of whatever appeals to him from the new-music arena. He&#8217;s also an investor and partner in a soon-to-open bar in Prague where the music will be one of the main attractions.</p>
<p>Net radio, he discovered, isn&#8217;t as easy as putting up a stream-able audio file. The bandwidth requirements can be awesome if you want serious quality and a large audience. So he&#8217;s rethinking the way he&#8217;ll do it, and is looking toward Internet multicasting and other technologies before he launches.</p>
<p>It all plainly agrees with Goodfellow, who&#8217;s 44 but looks years younger. </p>
<p>&#8220;I live in Heaven,&#8221; he says. &#8220;This is the most beautiful, civilized, cultural place I&#8217;ve ever seen. Tell me a more beautiful city than this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Czechs are part of the appeal. &#8220;They&#8217;re highly curious, intelligent people,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They&#8217;re practical and logical but also very non-conforming. That&#8217;s how I am.&#8221;</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Tech Share Implosion Follows Techies</font> </p>
<p>The fear and loathing sparked by the current rout in technology stocks followed the tech executives who&#8217;ve traveled here to the annual <a href="https://conference.dasar.com/oq/products.nsf">ETRE conference</a>. At dinner last night, the conversation included a discussion about whether, not when, technology would lead the markets up again. It&#8217;s surely leading the markets down at the moment.</p>
<p>The conversation, mainly among journalists, also got around to our frequently unseemly role in the Internet bubble. We celebrated the founder of every two-bit startup that had no serious business plan but incredible market capitalization, pretending that anyone could make and keep such loot.</p>
<p>It will be useful, the next time we see such a bubble, if journalists remember history. I doubt we will. I fear it&#8217;s not in our nature.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://conference.dasar.com/oq/products.nsf">ETRE conference</a> begins tomorrow here. I&#8217;m moderating a couple of panels about marketing, privacy, security and other issues relating to e-marketing and the Net in general. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m also going to visit some interesting people including Geoff Goodfellow, who founded RadioMail and became Silicon Valley&#8217;s most prominent expatriate here. Look for postings on all of this during the week as I have time.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>AOL&#8217;s Tactics</font> </p>
<p>More reasons why America Online&#8217;s buyout of Time Warner is a red flag for competition:</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28372-2000Oct6.html">this Washington Post story</a>, we learn about Time Warner&#8217;s onerous terms for Internet service providers that want to offer their service through Time Warner&#8217;s TV cable systems. They&#8217;re being offered access, &#8220;but only under conditions that would give the New York media giant a huge piece of their revenue and control over crucial content.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the Post reports <a href="http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40250-2000Oct9.html">AOL&#8217;s restrictions on Disney</a>, aiming &#8220;to deter users from leaving AOL&#8217;s network to reach competitors on the Web.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s AOL&#8217;s song-and-dance routine on instant messaging, in which it claims to support the concept of having messaging systems interoperate but is adamantly <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/eweek/stories/general/0,11011,2624259,00.html">opposing measures</a> (eWeek) that would ensure interoperability.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission has been a patsy on this issue, but may be gaining a backbone. The Federal Trade Commission, meanwhile, appears to be more anxious to help competition. With the European Commission apparently about to sign off on the deal, it&#8217;s up to the U.S. pro-competition forces to keep consumers&#8217; interests foremost.</p>
