				<p>Century Strategies, the public relations and lobbying firm run by Ralph Reed, the former executive director of the Christian Coalition, now says it <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/066365.htm"> won&#8217;t urge influential people</a> (AP) to personally lobby George W. Bush on Microsoft&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s progress. Sort of.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Internet Taxes &#8212; Governors Respond to Stacked Panel Report</font> </p>
<p>The anti-tax crowd managed to stack the Internet tax commission, but they couldn&#8217;t get the two-third majority they wanted for a recommendation that would continue the current unfair advantage that goes to Internet businesses over Main Street businesses. They did put out a majority report to that effect, but only after offering specific breaks to the businesses that were represented on the panel. </p>
<p>The entire charade infuriated more than two-thirds of the nation&#8217;s governors, many of whom have reputations as tax-cutters. And they&#8217;re about to <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/060267.htm">letting Congress know</a> (New York Times) just how bad a job the commission did.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>H-1B Visas &#8212; No Limit?</font> </p>
<p>That&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/front/docs/h1b041200.htm">latest ploy</a> (Mercury News) from a powerful member of Congress. The H-1B scandal just gets worse.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Winter in Detroit</font> </p>
<p>They played the first big-league baseball game yesterday at the new <a href="http://www.freep.com/index/comerica.htm">Comerica Park</a> in Detroit. It snowed in the morning, and a chilly sprinkle fell in the afternoon. </p>
<p>Comerica Park,  named after a bank that&#8217;s spending big bucks on the sponsorship, is the replacement for Tiger Stadium, a ballpark I frequented when I lived here in the late &#8217;80s and early &#8217;90s. It&#8217;s also a monument to corporate greed, political spinelessness and taxpayer stupidity.</p>
<p>Uncountable tax dollars are supporting this project, which wasn&#8217;t needed in the first place. Tiger Stadium was old and creaky, but it was a great place to see a ballgame, and could have been fixed up for much less money than was spent on the new edifice.</p>
<p>But this is the era when billionaires who employ millionaires extort hundreds of millions from taxpayers to build new entertainment arenas. And that&#8217;s what major league sports are &#8212; entertainment. The squandering of taxpayers&#8217; money for these things is unconscionable even in these boom times. Detroit taxpayers are particularly ill-served.</p>
<p>The other new landmarks in Detroit are two monumentally ugly casinos, another legacy of politicians&#8217; determination to fuel what they call &#8220;economic development&#8221; no matter what the cost to the people they allegedly serve. The Detroit casinos extract a million dollars from the local economy every day, by one estimate.</p>
<p>One of the casinos has already been the site of a suicide. An off-duty police officer lost more than he could afford at one of the blackjack tables at the MotorCity Casino, pulled out his gun and <a href="http://www.freep.com/news/casinos/cas27_20000127.htm">blew his brains out</a> (Detroit Free Press).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m told the casino had the table back in operation within a few hours.</p>

				<p>Three giant auto companies and two Silicon Valley technology companies have linked up in what is possibly the biggest-ever online project &#8212; a bazaar for auto components and other supplies. I stopped by the headquarters of the newly formed alliance, which is spinning off a separate company in suburban Detroit.</p>

<p><font size=4>Microsoft&#8217;s Latest Hired Gun: Ralph Reed</font> </p>
<p>Like any corporate wrongdoer with almost infinitely deep pockets, Microsoft is <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/top/docs/ms041100.htm">spreading money and influence</a> (Mercury News) all over Washington and the state capitals. If it can&#8217;t win in court, the company wants to win in Congress.</p>
<p>But it may take infinite shamelessness for a company that is so progressive with its own employees &#8212; and in the causes Bill Gates supports when he&#8217;s giving his own money &#8212; to be paying big money to the poster child for the forces of intolerance, ultra-right maven Ralph Reed. Reed&#8217;s job, according to various news reports, is to lobby George W. Bush, the all-but-certain Republican presidential nominee. </p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s possible to argue that Reed is just another lobbyist, no longer executive director of the Christian Coalition. He&#8217;s just another hired gun, and therefore a reasonable ally. So Microsoft is merely following the modern standard of behavior &#8212; what&#8217;s acceptable is what you can get away with.</p>
<p>Plainly, Microsoft sees this case as a fight to the death. On the other side is nothing all that important, just the rules of competition in the Information Age, and maybe the rule of law itself. </p>

<p><font size=4>GOP: We&#8217;re Not Abusing Domain Name System </font> </p>
<p>Last last week I pointed to a charge by activist Jim Warren that the Republican party was <a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/stories/storyReader$323">misusing the domain-name system</a>.</p>
<p>That prompted <a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/stories/storyReader$327">this rebuttal</a> from Richard Diamond, who works for Richard Armey, majority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s Interactive edition has <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/083952.htm">yanked off the Web</a> a report headlined &#8220;Will Microsoft Lose Right to Internet Explorer?&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Under the proposal,&#8221; the story had said, &#8220;Microsoft would be forced to grant royalty-free licenses to the product, opening its secret underlying software code to customers and computer makers. &#8220;</i></p>
<p>This morning, when I linked to the story, I said I couldn&#8217;t see how this would help improve competition. I asked for readers to <span class="email-removed" title="email address removed">clue me in</span> on how it might help.</p>

				<p>The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission is pulled and tugged by many forces. But the holder of that job is an enormously powerful person these days, in a world where telecommunications is becoming the epicenter of so much of what we do.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/kennard.htm">third installment</a> of my series, &#8220;Exploring Leadership,&#8221; Kennard talks about his way of doing things.</p>

<p><font size=4>Microsoft Honchos: Screw You, Judge Jackson</font> </p>
<p>Washington Post: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A34269-2000Apr7.html">On Home Turf, Microsoft Is Viewed as a Victim</a>.</p>
<p>
<blockquote><i>The antitrust proceedings were &#8220;a public show trial in the true sense of the word,&#8221; says Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft&#8217;s chief technology officer. &#8220;It was about innuendo, character assassination, completely unsupported claims.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This quote reminds me of the story about the philandering husband whose wife comes home to find him in bed with another woman. He says, &#8220;Who are you going to believe? Me or your lying eyes?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Microsoft trial was about facts. It revealed character. And the government claims were supported not just by the testimony from government witnesses, but by the voluminous written record from inside Microsoft itself &#8212; an avalanche of emails and other documents that demonstrated a pattern of lawbreaking. </p>
<p>I never fail to be amazed by this continuing level of arrogance at Microsoft, especially from a senior manager (albeit semi-retired, in Myhrvold&#8217;s case). It&#8217;s plainly counterproductive, because it&#8217;ll energize the Justice Department and state attorneys general to push for the harshest kind of sanctions. But the Microsoft kool-aid seems to breed hubris.</p>

				<p>When a well-informed California panel looked at the question of voting online, the members went into the project with great enthusiasm. When the finished, they said, &#8220;Whoa, let&#8217;s take this very, very slowly.&#8221;</p>
<p>David Jefferson, a Compaq Computer researcher who chaired the Technical Issues Committee of the California <a href="http://www.ss.ca.gov/executive/ivote/">Internet Voting Task Force</a>, gave that advice Friday at the annual <a href="http://www.cfp2000.org">Computers, Freedom and Privacy</a> conference. He cited a long list of potential problems and nightmare scenarios, and urged &#8220;extreme caution&#8221; before moving toward online voting.</p>
<p>Online voting, he said, is &#8220;vastly more difficult&#8221; than its proponents suggest. Moving ahead before there&#8217;s a foolproof way of preventing fraud would endanger the foundation of government. </p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Sure, but replacing the Internet Domain Name System is much easier said than done. That was the concensus yesterday at the annual <a href="http://www.cfp2000.org">Computers, Freedom and Privacy</a> conference. But speakers in a roundtable were in general agreement about several points.</p>
<p>The DNS essentially is the way that an Internet name, such as SILICONVALLEY.COM, is made unique on the Net so that when you  type &#8220;http://www.siliconvalley.com&#8221; in to your browser you are taken to that site and only that site (and when you send me mail to &#8220;dgillmor@sjmercury.com&#8221; it reaches me). That domain names gets translated into numbers, also known as IP (Internet Protocol) addresses.</p>
<p>The DNS was a marvel of ingenuity when it was invented, and worked brilliantly when the Net was mostly universities and government sites. In today&#8217;s commercial world it&#8217;s becoming a mess. Big companies, in particular, have turned the system into a giant land-grab &#8212; part of a larger land grab in the intellectual property arena &#8212; and have been abusive of the less powerful in the process.</p>
<p>The system is also based on a hierarchy, and therefore centralized. The hierarchical nature of the DNS isn&#8217;t so much the problem as the centralization, which gives the U.S. government and its proxy, the notorious Network Solutions Inc., a powerful choke hold over the system. NSI is a particularly nasty outfit, in my view.</p>
<p>Lenny Foner, from the MIT Media Lab, was a leader of the DNS session here. He handed out a proposal for replacing the system, noting that it won&#8217;t be easy. He suggests getting rid of the DNS and replacing it with a system that is not hierarchical and has several qualities:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<li>The system would rely on individual machines around the world to establish &#8220;relationships,&#8221; in effect, with nearby computers. Mine would learn about yours, which would tell a third about both, etc. (It&#8217;s actually much more complicated, but you get the general idea if I do, and I hope I do. I&#8217;ll post a link to Foner&#8217;s paper when he posts it on the Net, which he promises to do.)
<li>Names would no longer be unique, and you wouldn&#8217;t always be able to get to a named site without more information.
<li>Land grabs would be harder, because the grabbing would be much more expensive.
<li>People could register an unlimited number of names at no cost to them.
<li>Routing of IP traffic wouldn&#8217;t be affected.</p></blockquote>
<p>Several people at the discussion said getting rid of DNS isn&#8217;t as much a matter of replacing it as building on top of it or around it until DNS is someday not needed anymore. That seemed sensible.</p>
<p>Nor is a hierarchical system necessarily so bad, said John Gilmore of the <a href="http://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>. After all, it does work well to sort out various names.</p>
<p>To put it mildly, this is one tough problem. The reality is that big companies, which can exert strong control over their brands in cyberspace &#8212; and unfairly wipe out small fry that have the same name in a different context &#8212; like that system just fine for the moment even if it&#8217;s inconvenient at times.</p>
<p>One proposal now in the works would add numerous &#8220;Top Level Domains&#8221; to the three mainly used today &#8212; .com, .net and .org, all of which NSI controls much too strongly. For example, we might have a .union level for the labor movement, and a .consumer level for people to comment on companies&#8217; products, etc. I&#8217;d like to see thousands, if not more, of new top level domains.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on a long column on this subject, and would like to hear your ideas. Please let me know <span class="email-removed" title="email address removed">what you think</span>.</p>

<p>An appeals court has ruled that <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1641004.html">computer programs are speech</a> (News.com story), not weapons. This is a huge victory for civil liberties. </p>

<p><font size=4>Microsoft Settles Antitrust Case, Admits Guilt &#8212; Not</font> </p>
<p><i>Indeed, U.S. Court of Appeals Chief Judge Richard Posner, who&#8217;d been mediating the settlement talks, announced on Saturday &#8212; not a joke &#8212; announced the talks had broken down. Here&#8217;s Posner&#8217;s statement:</i></p>
<p>&#8220;I regret to announce the end of my efforts to mediate the Microsoft antitrust case. Since my acceptance of this assignment on November 19 of last year, I have endeavored to find common ground that might enable the parties to settle their differences without further litigation. Unfortunately, the quest has proved fruitless. After more than four months, it is apparent that the disagreements among the parties concerning the likely course, outcome, and consequences of continued litigation, as well as the implications and ramifications of alternative terms of settlement, are too deep-seated to be bridged. This result is disappointing not only because of the amount of time that so many busy professionals, officials, and executives have devoted to the mediation, but also because the public interest would be served by avoiding further litigation, with its potential for unsettling a key industry in the global economy. I believed when I undertook this assignment that it was in the national interest that the case be settled, and I believe it even more strongly today.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mediation is a confidential process, and I do not intend to make any public or private comments on the merits of the litigation, the negotiating positions of the parties, the individuals involved in the negotiations, or the content of any of the communications between the parties&#8217; mediation teams and myself. I can, however, without impropriety, say this much: Despite my strenuous efforts to maintain the confidentiality of the mediation, there has been a good deal of leaking and spinning, and this leaking and spinning have given rise to news reports that have created a misleading impression of several aspects of the process and that should be heavily discounted by anyone interested in hewing to the truth. One reason for my issuing this public statement is to correct the impression created by some news reports that there were no serious negotiations over possible terms of settlement until two weeks ago. On the contrary, almost twenty successive drafts of a possible consent decree, evolved over the past months, had been considered by the parties before it became clear late last night that the case would not settle, at least at this stage of the litigation. I particularly want to emphasize that the collapse of the mediation is not due to any lack of skill, flexibility, energy, determination, or professionalism on the part of the Department of Justice and Microsoft Corporation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not intend to make any further statements about the mediation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like, in closing, to commend Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson for his efforts to bring about a settlement, and to thank him for according me the honor of asking me to mediate this complex, fascinating, and immensely important case.&#8221;</p>
