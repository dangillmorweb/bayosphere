				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>The Supreme Court will be obeyed when it gives the 2000 presidential election to George W. Bush, as  now seems almost inevitable, but an irreplaceable institution will be severely damaged. Partisanship is as much as part of the high court&#8217;s process, I fear, as law.</p>
<p>Newspapers routinely show politicians&#8217; political affiliations when we write about them. I suppose we&#8217;ll have to do the same in the future for court justices. I can see it now:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><i>Chief Justice William Rehnquist (R-Arizona), writing in the majority opinion, said the court finds a federal issue in this case even though there isn&#8217;t one. Associate Justice Stephen Breyer (D-Mass.), in a dissent, said the decision would damage states&#8217; rights&#8230;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>(If you&#8217;re interested in how the justices and lawyers for both sides debated this case at Monday&#8217;s oral arguments, check out the <a href="http://oyez.org/election/00-949.portraits.ram">streaming coverage</a> provided by Northwestern University&#8217;s <a href="http://www.oyez.org">Oyez Project</a>. You can read the transcript as you listen to the arguments. A great service.)</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Back from the Road</font> </p>
<p>Another productive trip Asia. The teaching gig at the <a href="http://www.hku.hk">University of Hong Kong</a> is a great deal of fun and hard work. The students were challenging and, in the end, excellent. Their final papers have arrived, and I will be spending time on them this weekend.</p>
<p>Spent the weekend in Charleston, South Carolina, with my brother and his family. The occasion was my niece&#8217;s 7th birthday. </p>
<p>Happy Birthday, Naomi!</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai </font> </p>
<p>I visited Singapore and Shanghai in addition to Hong Kong this trip, and started wondering which one of these places might emerge as the principal city of east Asia in the new century. Perhaps there&#8217;s room for more than one.</p>
<p>Whichever, you can see my speculation in my <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg121000.htm">Sunday column</a>.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Intel and Reality </font> </p>
<p>Less than 48 hours after the CEO of Intel, Craig Barrett, assured me that <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg120600.htm">all was just peachy</a> with his company, Intel <a href="http://cgi.mercurycenter.com/premium/business/docs/intel08.htm">warned that revenues were hurting</a> (Mercury News) because of the worldwide PC sales problem. </p>
<p>Barrett had even taken pains during our interview to say that he was baffled why the market responded to the troubles at Gateway, a big PC company, by pounding Intel&#8217;s stock. After all, he said, home PC sales were a &#8220;de minimus&#8221; part of Intel&#8217;s market. Here&#8217;s Intel&#8217;s <a href="http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/cn120700.htm">press release</a> on the same topic.</p>
<p>I still think Intel is a great company. I still agree with Barrett that the long run for technology is positive indeed.</p>
<p>Did Barrett deliberately mislead me? Intel says no. </p>
<p>But I come away from the experience with the distinct impression that I was misled. And I fear my column, while giving an accurate picture of Barrett&#8217;s outlook on global matters, didn&#8217;t reflect reality.</p>
<p>UPDATE:<br />
<blockquote>From an Intel spokesman: <i>&#8220;What we announced last Thursday could not have been disclosed or hinted at ahead of time due to securities regulations.  To tell you in advance what would be announced later would constitute selective disclosure.  In any case, we were still in the process of assimilating data to see whether we would still meet revenue expectations.  When it became clear we would not, we announced it.  As I read Craig&#8217;s remarks, at least those that appeared in your column, they referred not so much to the PC market as the long-term future of the overall buildout of Internet infrastructure. </i></p></blockquote>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Fox, the GOP Network </font> </p>
<p>AP: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/12/tv.foxexecutive.ap/">Fox executive spoke five times with cousin Bush on Election Night</a>. <i>In their final conversation on election night, Bush told Ellis that Al Gore had taken back his concession of the race. &#8220;I hope you&#8217;re taking all this down, Ellis,&#8221; Bush reportedly said. &#8220;This is good stuff for a book.</i><br />
<blockquote>What this says about George W. Bush is almost as interesting as the utter lack of journalistic ethics it reveals about the Fox Network, which has been a Republican shill since it was formed, and John Ellis, the Bush cousin.</p></blockquote>
<p></p></blockquote>

<p>One of the joys of being out of the country the past five weeks has been the inability to tune in American TV networks&#8217; all-consuming coverage of the election. Now, sitting in the newsroom, I hear Bush&#8217;s mouthpiece, James Baker, explaining why the rule of law is a bad idea.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure the Florida Supreme Court made a <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/local/center/pmsupreme120.htm">good decision</a> to keep the recounts going. I hope the U.S. Supreme Court will settle this deal one way or the other, and do it soon.</p>

				<p>Craig Barrett, president and CEO at <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel Corp.</a>, is baffled by the stock market. He&#8217;s also bullish on Intel. Well, he would be.</p>
<p>Barrett was in town to give a speech at the International Telecommunication Union&#8217;s <a href="http://www.itu.int/ASIA2000/">Telecom Asia 2000</a> conference and exhibition. As such things go, it was more of an Intel pep talk than an issue-laden keynote address, but all CEOs tend to do the same thing.</p>
<p>Last night, in an interview, Barrett offered some positive views on the technology revolution and said Intel is well positioned to be a leader in communications as well as computing, which are coming together, anyway. Look for Intel Everywhere, not just Inside.</p>
<p>He remains puzzled about Wall Street&#8217;s manic-depressive state. &#8220;One day you can be a buy for everybody and the next day be a sell,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I find it strange.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have more of this interview here soon.</p>

<p><font size=4>China&#8217;s Continuing Internet Controls</font></p>
<p>China&#8217;s authoritarian regime doesn&#8217;t get it. And, it seems, doesn&#8217;t want to get it.</p>
<p>The Minister of Information Industry, Wu Jichuan, said here yesterday at the telecom show that his government is working on a <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/053752.htm">&#8220;better way&#8221;</a>  to regulate and control the Net. The purpose, he claimed, was to protect individuals&#8217; privacy and reputations.</p>
<p>Trust us, he&#8217;s saying. This is for people&#8217;s own good.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t buy it. This is for the Chinese government&#8217;s own good &#8212; for the continuing control over information in a land where freedom of information is viewed as a threat to the regime.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>The Carnivore Review: Thin Gruel</font></p>
<p>Some of the most knowledgable people in the computer security and networking fields have taken a look at the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/jmd/publications/carniv_entry.htm">&#8220;independent technical review&#8221;</a> of the FBI&#8217;s Carnivore software, which law enforcement uses to spy on Internet users. Here&#8217;s what these top-flight experts say:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><i>&#8220;The limited nature of the analysis described in the draft report simply cannot support a conclusion that Carnivore is correct, safe, or always consistent with legal limitations. Those who are concerned that the system produces correct evidence, represents no threat to the networks on which it is installed, or complies with the scope of court orders should not take much comfort from the analysis described in the report or its conclusions.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Remember, when the FBI first started looking for third parties to review Carnivore, several begged off, saying the examination process was not transparent or open enough to ensure a genuine analysis. The FBI tried to keep secret the identies of the people it ultimately selected to do the review, but in a stupid technical mistake the names became public. Guess what? Critics said it was <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2636879,00.html">a stacked deck </a>. </p>
<p>Come on. You didn&#8217;t really expect that law-enforcement people wanted a thorough and fair review, did you?</p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, key members of Congress on both sides of the aisle are <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2657976,00.html">asking hard questions</a> (Reuters) about this spyware, too. Let&#8217;s hope that the Republicans who are so ardent about protecting civil liberties stay that way when George W. Bush&#8217;s Justice Department tries to shred the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s also hope we end up with a system that doesn&#8217;t spit on due process. Given the attitudes of law enforcement these days and Congress&#8217; tendency to fold when threatened with being &#8220;soft on crime,&#8221; I fear that may be a forlorn hope.</p>

<p><font size=4>British Government&#8217;s Big Brother Urges </font></p>
<p>The Observer: <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk//uk_news/story/0,6903,406191,00.html">Secret plan to spy on all British phone calls </a>. <i>Every telephone call made and received by a member of the public, all emails sent and received and every web page looked at would be recorded.</i><br />
<blockquote>And kept in a giant database for seven years. Or more likely, if such a plan went through, forever.</p>
<p>The British government&#8217;s growing passion for spying on its people is one of the most remarkable, and disheartening, trends of modern times. The nation that came up with the Magna Carta is now leading the way toward the most corrosive of regimes, a system under which no citizen would have even the slightest right to be left alone.</p>
<p>Tony Blair&#8217;s Labor government is far more reactionary in its civil-liberties positions than even Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s administration at its most repressive. Is this the Third Way, to abrogate human rights just because the police think their jobs would be easier if civil liberties were utterly done away with?</p>
<p>Why do the British people put up with this? For the same reason, apparently, that they embrace the placement of spy cameras in almost every public place.</p>
<p>The British would rather have safety than freedom. In the end, to paraphrase Ben Franklin, an American patriot who understood reality, they will have neither.</p></blockquote>

<p><font size=4>Wall Street&#8217;s Financial Flunkies</font></p>
<p>Gretchen Morgenson (New York Times; registration required): <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/03/business/03WATC.html">Memo to Analysts: Thanks for Nothing</a>. <i>Your inability to see trouble at a company when it is staring you in the face &#8212; so that you could alert your customers to problems before their stocks plummet &#8212; has cost us billions of dollars in recent weeks. Your performance is a disgrace.</i><br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s a disgrace, all right, but it&#8217;s not a surprise. </p>
<p>Morgenson has been one of the best financial journalists for long time. Investors would have been far better off to listen to her than the &#8220;analysts&#8221; who have been such patsies for the companies they follow.</p>
<p>In too many cases, Wall Street analysts have been little more than public-relations aides for the companies they follow. And, not coincidentally, those companies&#8217; stock offerings have often been underwritten by the investment banks that employ the analysts.</p>
<p>Sadly, the people in my business keep quoting them as if they were the oracles of our times. Yes, analysts can say intelligent things. They are not stupid people. But anyone &#8212; investor or journalist &#8212; who trusts their investment recommendations is gullible. No, foolish.</p>
<p>The analysts who helped their investment banks make mega-millions in IPO, secondary-offering and M&#038;A fees over the past few years have probably earned their outrageous paychecks. Unfortunately, I fear, the public hasn&#8217;t realized who the analysts were working for &#8212; and all too often, it plainly wasn&#8217;t the investing public.</p></blockquote>

<p><font size=4>Richard Li, Superstar</font></p>
<p><img src="http://static2.userland.com/pictures/ejournal/richardli1.jpg" height="288" width="444" border="0" alt="ITURichardLi: Richard Li at ITU show, Hong Kong"></p>
<p>The man in the blue shirt in the middle of this picture is Richard Li, chief executive of Pacific Century CyberWorks (PCCW), a company that has become the symbol of Hong Kong&#8217;s technology community. It soared to the highest heights early this year, but has fallen to some deep lows in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Li is the most visible business person in Hong Kong these days. He&#8217;s surrounded by cameras in every venue. Here, he&#8217;s stopping by the International Telecommunications Union&#8217;s Telecom Asia 2000 show and forum, where PCCW is a major sponsor.</p>
<p>Its sponsorship makes sense. Earlier this year, PCCW bought the largest telephone company in Hong Kong, based largely on a share price that is no longer even in the same universe that it was at the time. Call it luck, or a brazen, legal theft. Now PCCW is more of a telecommunications company than anything else.</p>
<p>I profiled Li and his company during my visit here last year. I&#8217;ve been talking with lots of the top managers at the company since coming back to Hong Kong early in November, and I&#8217;m planning a major update. This is one fascinating company.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>The right-wing Heritage Foundation recently declared Hong Kong to be the world&#8217;s freest economy. It based the rating on a variety of factors that you can judge for yourself by looking at the foundation&#8217;s <a href="http://www.index.heritage.org">&#8220;Index of Economic Freedom&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Heritage folks don&#8217;t worry about cartels and monopolies in their observations. Hong Kong is a hotbed of competition in many areas, such as telecommunications. But it&#8217;s also home to some of the greatest market concentration on the planet in key industries.</p>
<p>The government in this &#8220;Special Administrative Region&#8221; of China severely restricts the available supply of land for housing, for example. There&#8217;s plenty of land that could  be developed outside the central city, but it&#8217;s not being used. The result is one of the artificially highest costs of housing anywhere.</p>
<p>Then there are the powerful families that control huge parts of the local economy. A few families control real-estate development, shipping, supermarkets and other vital assets here. Challenging the family empires doesn&#8217;t get you very far, by all accounts.</p>
<p>Apart from the damage caused to average consumers by cartels and oligopolies, family-run big businesses are not necessarily good for shareholders, either. The International Herald Tribune reported an <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2973.html">upcoming study</a> by economists from the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Catholic University of Milan, in which key findings show that &#8220;&#8221;prominent family-run businesses also are prone to enriching themselves at the expense of small shareholders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, Hong Kong is economically quite free. And despite some ominous signs of interference from the mainland it remains mostly free in other respects, such as the right to speak one&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>The Heritage study is really about government interference. If allowing cartels and oligopolies to operate with impunity is a demonstration of freedom, that&#8217;s an odd definition of the word in my book.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>A View from the Valley</font></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve given a couple of talks this week to Hong Kong audiences that want to know how the world looks from the belly of the beast, a.k.a. Silicon Valley. In both cases I&#8217;ve made clear that I don&#8217;t speak for the valley, but reflect my own observations that may or may not be congruent with valley thinking.</p>
<p>I started each talk out by showing a slide:</p>
<p><img src="http://static2.userland.com/pictures/ejournal/netbiz.jpg" height="356" width="475" border="0" alt="NetBizModel: Net Business Model?"><br />I used to show this slide to describe the typical dot-com business plan. Happily, it no longer works.</p>
<p>But the hockey-stick curve had a purpose beyond making a joke. I then showed the following slides, representing the exponential improvements we&#8217;re seeing in processing power, storage and bandwidth:</p>
<p><img src="http://static2.userland.com/pictures/ejournal/processing.jpg" height="270" width="360" border="0" alt="ProcessingCurve: Moore's Law"><br /><img src="http://static2.userland.com/pictures/ejournal/storage.jpg" height="270" width="360" border="0" alt="StorageCurve: Storage curve"><br /><img src="http://static2.userland.com/pictures/ejournal/bandwidth.jpg" height="270" width="360" border="0" alt="BandwidthCurve: Bandwidth exponential curve"></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no human analog for improvements of this sort. None. </p>
<p>Then I asked, what happens when we combine these trends:</p>
<p><img src="http://static2.userland.com/pictures/ejournal/nowwhat.jpg" height="270" width="360" border="0" alt="WhatItAllMeans: Putting the curves together"><br />Actually, we don&#8217;t multiply these trends together, most likely. But nor do we simply add these things together. I suspect it&#8217;s somewhere in between. The point is that these improvements feed on each other.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re making everything smarter. We&#8217;re giving everything memory. And we&#8217;re connecting everything at high rates of speed. What does this mean?</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;re just beginning to find out.</p>
<p><i>(That&#8217;s how I began each speech. If anyone&#8217;s interested, I&#8217;ll post more of the slides and explain where I went from there.)</i></p>

<p>Lee Kuan Yew was this city-state&#8217;s first prime minister. He&#8217;s now the &#8220;Senior Minister&#8221; of Singapore. Whatever you think of his politics, which emphatically do not conform to some fundamental American political values including untrammeled free speech, his leadership has been serious and strong.</p>
<p>Singapore is trying to move into a new era, and it&#8217;s facing some choices that clearly are uncomfortable for Lee and his colleagues in the government and industry. They are trying to move toward an economy based as much or more on knowledge as the manufacturing, financial services, transportation and tourism that have largely sustained this tiny place for the past generation.</p>
<p>Over the past four days I&#8217;ve interviewed Lee and leaders of the government&#8217;s economic and telecommunications agencies, and visited two of Singapore&#8217;s key research labs. They know what they want to do. Whether they&#8217;ll be able to pull it off is not something I can judge right now. But they are, it seems, doing some of the right things.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have more on this in coming days.</p>

<p><font size=4>Hong Kong&#8217;s Amazing Telecoms</font></p>
<p>One of Singapore&#8217;s main rivals in the region is Hong Kong. Each has some advantages, but one of Hong Kong&#8217;s main strengths is its telecommunications scene &#8212; probably the world&#8217;s most competitive.</p>

<p>Singapore was described to me as resembling a golf course, ever-so-groomed and maintained. That&#8217;s true, but it&#8217;s also a work in transitition.</p>
<p>I visited one of the city-state&#8217;s national research centers on Friday. It&#8217;s called <a href="www.krdl.org.sg">Kent Ridge Digital Labs</a> (KRDL), and it&#8217;s out by the <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a> on the western side of this small island.</p>
<p>KRDL is an information-technology research lab, aimed mostly at software. It&#8217;s a key part of Singapore&#8217;s effort to move its economy into the new age. It thrived in recent decades on financial services, transportation and manufacturing &#8212; with high-tech manufacturing a particular expertise. </p>
<p>Can Singapore create a new economic force from brainpower? That&#8217;s not entirely clear. </p>
<p>Certainly some of the technologists here are as bright and capable as the ones who flock each year to Silicon Valley and the rest of the United States. I&#8217;m not sure if the local culture is as accomodating of creative thinking, of the individualism that seems to accompany the most successful entrepeneurship.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m meeting with government officials tomorrow. Singapore&#8217;s government is clearly the most important economic player, even in a largely capitalistic system.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>The Bush Tactics</font></p>
<p>The Republicans&#8217; hypocrisy is beyond belief. Their contempt for law and support of mob rule is frightening.</p>
<p>The Bush crowd screamed bloody murder when the Democrats, looking at the bizarre &#8220;butterfly&#8221; ballot in Palm Beach County, Florida, said it caused Gore voters to mistakenly vote for the right-winger Pat Buchanan. How dare anyone even think that these votes might be counted.</p>
<p>But the Republicans <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/25/absentee.ballots/">want to count absentee ballots</a> (CNN) <i>that are equally invalid</i>. &#8220;A technicality,&#8221; scream the GOP public-releations hordes. </p>
<p>Then the Republicans started making noise about throwing out the Florida results if they don&#8217;t like what the recount shows. Maybe the Republican state legislature will vote for Bush electors. Maybe Congress.</p>
<p>These are people who would abandon the rule of law when it doesn&#8217;t suit them. They seem to be much more motivated than the Democratic activists, which is why they may win. </p>
<p>They are looking mighty hypocritical. They are also looking downright dangerous.</p>
<p>The Bush supporters used nothing short of <a href="http://slate.msn.com/code/ThisJustIn/ThisJustIn.asp?Show=11/24/2000&#038;idMessage=6549">goonish tactics</a> to intimidate the Dade County elections officials into dropping their recount.</p>
<p>Two days ago, in my <a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/2000/11/23">Thanksgiving column</a>, I said the world was looking at the U.S. process not with disdain but with awe. We were following the rule of law, not mob behavior. I was wrong.</p>
<p>I am nearly ashamed of my country today. The Republican mob wants its man to be president, no matter what it takes. THere is a the cost to democracy, to the rule of law. They should think about what they&#8217;re doing, and so should their leaders in the GOP and their syncophants in the media.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been critical of the Gore team&#8217;s insistence on counting the so-called &#8220;dimpled chads.&#8221; But nothing Gore is doing begins to match the Bush crowd&#8217;s activities.</p>
<p>Bush may well take the oath of office as our next president. If he does, he will be a barely legitimate president in my view, though he will be a legal one and I will acknowledge his legal holding of the office. </p>
<p>But I will fervently hope Congressional Democrats have the courage to stand up to him and Trent Lott and Tom DeLay and the other right-wingers who want to turn America back decades socially and politically. And I hope they will resist the GOP&#8217;s rampage against law and order.</p>

<p><font size=4>Gore is Over-Reaching on &#8220;Dimpled Chads&#8221; </font></p>
<p>San Jose Mercury News: <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/local/center/ballots1122.htm">Ballots set to make dent in U.S. history</a>. <i>Democrats are arguing that local election officials should count ballots in which voters did not punch their ballots hard enough to dislodge the so-called chad that would signal their preferred candidate but did make a slight indentation in the chad. Democrats say the indentations clearly demonstrate a voter&#8217;s intent.</i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Al Gore and his allies have gone way over the line this time.</p>
<p>In its ruling okaying the hand counts in three disputed counties, the Florida Supreme Court did not, contrary to the Gore camp&#8217;s absurd claims, approve of counting these &#8220;dimpled chads.&#8221; The court only said that &#8220;voters should not be disfranchised where their intent may be ascertained with reasonable certainty, simply because the chad they punched did not completely dislodge from the ballot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Read that carefully. It says &#8220;completely dislodge&#8221; &#8212; and that is not an invitation to count a ballot where the chad hasn&#8217;t been at least partly dislodged.</p>
<p>An indentation is not a vote. It is not a clear indication of intent. It is a &#8220;Hmmm, maybe I should do this, or maybe not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gore had a strong case for a hand recount. He offered the Bush campaign an entirely fair option, a hand recount of all counties in Florida. The Republicans declined.</p>
<p>Bush&#8217;s tactics have been sleazy all through this campaign. If he takes the oath of office in January he will not be a fully legitimate president in my view.</p>
<p>But the &#8220;dimpled chad&#8221; ploy is reprehensible. I voted for Gore, but if he persists in this line of attack he will deserve to lose.</p>
