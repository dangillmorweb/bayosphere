				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>The <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/chronicle/">San Francisco Chronicle</a>, now owned by Hearst Corp., says it intends to put out a world-class newspaper in the city. Good. San Francisco deserves better newspapers than the ones that have been the mainstays all these years.
</p>
<p>The Chronicle and <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/examiner">Examiner</a> have their share of superb reporters and editors. Under the joint-operating agreement that had been in place, they put out two sub-par papers, because they didn&#8217;t individually have the resources to publish one excellent paper. Maybe, together, that will change.
</p>
<p>Hearst has a lot to prove, beyond the fact that it doesn&#8217;t publish many respectable papers today. The way it has conducted itself in this buyout, making sleazy deals with politicians and alleged competitors, has been an ethical disgrace.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry to see the Examiner (at least the one we knew) die. But newspaper economics today are not condusive to having two major hometown dailies in a city like San Francisco.
</p>
<p>Competition for the city and suburban readers won&#8217;t lag, however. My own paper is boosting its circulation in the city, adding reporters and editors and a special edition, and we compete hard in our Web presence. There are dozens of interesting Bay Area-related Web sites, magazines and smaller papers, and a variety of not broadcasting outlets.
</p>
<p>All of this competitive activity is good for people who care about news. The competition improves the quality of the report. It should improve the quality of readers&#8217; lives if they care about newspapers.

				<p>Wired News: <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,41686,00.html">Follow Your E-Mail Everywhere </a>.<i>&#8220;Any time such information is passed back to a sender without the recipients&#8217; knowledge and permission, it is a violation of their privacy,&#8221; said Lauren Weinstein, co-founder of the People for Internet Responsibility. &#8220;The whole thing is predicated on people not knowing what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</i>
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Web bugs&#8221; are tags placed in HTML code. You can&#8217;t see them when reading your e-mail, but they send a message back to the sender to say you&#8217;ve opened the mail.
<p>This is a huge invasion of privacy, of course. But there&#8217;s an even worse possibility, if you consider the security issues this raises in other ways.
</p>
<p>The only way to prevent this is to use a mail reader that only reads plain text. Unfortunately, the popular mail readers don&#8217;t allow you to turn off the HTML reading function, as far as I can tell. Why not?
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve asked Microsoft this question, given how many of us use Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express for e-mail. I&#8217;m also going to call Netscape and Qualcomm (Eurora). I&#8217;ll let you know what they say..<br />.</p></blockquote>
<p><font size=4>Amazon&#8217;s New Surveillance Potential</font>
</p>
<p>I spent some time yesterday looking into Amazon.com&#8217;s latest business move &#8212; its so-called <a href="http://s1.amazon.com/exec/varzea/subst/fx/help/payor-faq.html/058-8333239-2649946">Honor System</a>, a way to create online tip jars and payments. In its current incarnation, privacy fears may be somewhat overblown.
</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t really trust Amazon. Part of this is my continuing disgust with the company&#8217;s unrepentant abuse of the patent system. But Amazon&#8217;s privacy record also leaves something to be desired.
</p>
<p>More in my <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg020701.htm">Wednesday column</a>.
</p>
<p>UPDATE </p>
<li>Amazon tried to persuade me that it had answered the concerns raised by Jason Catlett of JunkBusters, a pro-privacy organization. I asked Catlett if that was true. He said no, and referred me to <a href="http://www.junkbusters.com/news">this page</a> on this Website (which was not responding when I tried it this morning).
<li>At <a href="http://http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/02/06">Dave Winer&#8217;s suggestion</a>, I&#8217;ve also asked Amazon&#8217;s PR folks twice now whether they&#8217;re trying to obtain a patent on the Honor System. They haven&#8217;t responded to that question, even though they&#8217;ve answered other ones. I&#8217;ll let you know if and when they do respond. If they don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll take the answer to be yes, that they are seeking a patent on the Honor System.

<p><font size=4>Amazon&#8217;s Business Troubles</font>
</p>
<p>Wall Street Journal: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/527473.asp">Amazon to charge publishers to promote books by e-mail</a>. <i>The Seattle-based Internet retailer recently notified publishers that it will begin to charge them as much as $10,000 per title in exchange for a better shot at having Amazon recommend their books in special e-mail promotions sent to customers.</i>
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The sour odor of panic is beginning to waft from Amazon. The company is showing that it will consider any tactic, however ethically challenged, in order to make money.
</p>
<p>Amazon claims it&#8217;ll reject books from this program if it feels they&#8217;re unworthy. Maybe at first, but there will be an inescapable urge to find worthiness when the money is right.
</p>
<p>The company is under enormous pressure to show a profit, and soon. That&#8217;s the way things work now that Wall Street&#8217;s manic-depressive traders have stopped persuading investors to throw money at startups without considering if or when they&#8217;ll make a nickel.
</p>
<p>But in making a deal like this, Amazon is risking more trouble than the move is worth.</p></blockquote>

<li>New York Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/07/cyber/cyberlaw/28law.html">Treat eBay Listings as Property? Lawyers See a Threat</a>. <i>In addition, because the Internet is built on the exchange of electronic signals, the trespass theory can be used by a Web site to prevent many types of online transactions, the professors warn. They contend that unauthorized linking would be in danger, as are general search engines.</i>
<li>Wired News: <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,37871,00.html">eBay Accused of Monpolization</a>. <i>Antitrust drums of war do beat about eBay, although they beat softly. A MotleyFool study completed in February put eBay&#8217;s market share in the consumer-to-consumer auction space at 85 percent &#8212; a figure that sets off bells in an antitrust attorney&#8217;s mind. Also, the Department of Justice recently initiated a preliminary probe of eBay&#8217;s activities.</i></p>

				<p>I have finally succeeded in signing up for a public, at-large membership at <a href="http://www.icann.org">ICANN</a>, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, after multiple attempts to get through to the organization&#8217;s overloaded membership server. You should <a href="http://members.icann.org/">sign up</a>, too.</p>
<p>ICANN is the body responsible for governing the domain-name system on the Internet. Its decisions, which go to the core of the Net&#8217;s inner workings, are important to us all.</p>
<p>The public is allowed to participate in a small way, through the election of at-large board members. The value of being an at-large public member is debatable, I concede, given the ICANN board&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg071700.htm">tendency to make autocratic decisions</a>, and the organization&#8217;s strong tilt toward the powerful interests that are dominating the system today, namely big companies, governments and trademark holders, is another less-than-positive sign.</p>
<p>But we make a mistake if we throw up our hands and decide it&#8217;s not worth the trouble even to try. That&#8217;s why I implore you to sign up, if you haven&#8217;t already, on the ICANN <a href="http://members.icann.org/">membership site</a>. </p>
<p>Registration ends on Monday. The servers have been grossly overloaded, but several people have written me to say they were able to sign up after several attempts. </p>
<p>Please <a href="http://members.icann.org">register</a>, if you care about the future of the Internet. </p>

<p><font size=4>Old Media Opening Up? </font> </p>
<p>The traditional media are notorious for their resistance to change. We are especially challenged by the Net&#8217;s multi-faceted nature, and in particular its many-to-many communications capabilities. Traditional journalism is a lecture. The Net is a conversation.</p>
<p>Many of us have discussion forums on our Web sites, which are useful beginnings into a more conversational style of journalism. One place that does this well, by dint of its international readership, is the &#8220;Gray Lady,&#8221; aka the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a>. Its ambitious Web site &#8212; one of the best, IMO &#8212; includes discussion groups where readers argue about major topics selected by the Times online editors.</p>
<p>But a more interesting, if largely unknown, part of the Times&#8217; online services is <a href="http://www.abuzz.com">Abuzz</a>, a question-and-answer site, where the general public asks and answers the questions. The staff&#8217;s editorial function is to keep things running smoothly, as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Now, this kind of thing isn&#8217;t new. Other sites do it just as well if not better. And you tend to find the best answers in a given topic by going to topic-specific sites.</p>
<p>Still, I&#8217;m glad that the august New York Times has seen fit to do this. &#8220;All the News That&#8217;s Fit to Print&#8221; no longer fits into the pages of the newspaper, as the Times has learned. It doesn&#8217;t even fit on the official NYT Web site. Maybe there&#8217;s a lesson there for all of us.</p>
