				<p>Tuesday, Dec. 7 &#8212;</p>
<p>If Microsoft is legally found to be a monopoly and that ruling holds up on appeal, suing the company on antitrust grounds gets easier, much easier. I have no doubt that competitors and consumers &#8212; and competition itself &#8212; have been harmed by Microsoft&#8217;s behavior. But I have a lot of qualms about the raft of civil cases being filed purportedly on behalf of consumers. </p>
<p>I explain why in <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg120799.htm">Tuesday&#8217;s column</a>.</p>

<p><font size=4>Mars Lander, but Not the Space Program, R.I.P.</font></p>
<p>Tuesday, Dec. 7 &#8212;</p>
<p>Okay, so <a href="http://www.cnn.com/1999/TECH/space/12/07/mars.lander.02/">the Mars Lander has failed</a> (CNN). This is a bad day for one part of a larger program of exploration.</p>
<p>Before we join the latest round of hand-wringing, however, let&#8217;s remember that space exploration is inherently dangerous. Failure is part of the process. There&#8217;s no evidence that this mishap was caused by human error, as was the case in another recent Mars probe. It appears to have simply been the luck of the draw.</p>
<p>The need for space exploration is so vast that we cannot stop. Not only is such questing in our very nature, but we are an expansionist species. Curiosity is an admirable trait, even if imperialism is not. We must learn what we can about our neighborhood, and thereby learn about our origins, and we must eventually move off of this planet. The survivial of the species may depend on it.</p>
<p>Should NASA, JPL and the like continue to have a near-monopoly on space exploration? I&#8217;d like to see private industry get more and more into this game, but I don&#8217;t see corporate interests looking to do the kind of research that our tax dollars have been funding. I&#8217;m happy to see some of my taxes go toward the space agency. </p>
<p>There will now be the inevitable calls for investigations into the competence of the people running the space program. Yes, let&#8217;s investigate the failures. But the failure of some risky unmanned missions &#8212; and, yes, even some future ones with human beings aboard &#8212; is not just a possibility. It&#8217;s inevitable, too, and part of the process of human exploration.</p>
<p>Keep going, NASA, JPL and the rest of the space-faring community. You still have plenty of support out here.</p>

<p><font size=4>The 39 Questions</font></p>
<p>Tuesday, Dec. 7 &#8212;</p>
<p>A Website devoted to the Year 2000 computer glitch has put me and other journalists on a list of people to be contacted, and as a result I&#8217;m getting bombarded with near-identical e-mail messages. Each tells me my publication is doing a poor job of reporting Y2K issues, and demands answers to <a href="http://www.y2knewswire.com/39questions.txt">39 Y2K questions</a>.</p>
<p>A few of the questions are at least interesting, and I&#8217;d like to know the answers. Others are just ridiculous, such as:</p>
<p>&#8220;31. Why are Californians urged to have a two-week stockpile of supplies for earthquake preparedness, but only a three-day stockpile for Y2K? Should Californians throw out eleven days of supplies to be politically correct for Y2K?&#8221;</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>I remain convinced that the biggest single danger we face from Y2K is panic. And I won&#8217;t hold my breath waiting for the panic mongerers to apologize when and if they&#8217;re proved wrong.</p>

				<p>Monday, Dec. 6 &#8212;</p>
<p>The Economist magazine, probably the best journal of its kind in the world, has an <a href="http://www.economist.com/editorial/freeforall/current/index_wb4516.html">interesting piece</a> this week about the notion of open-source journalism. I was interviewed for the article, and got a brief mention. (They spelled my name wrong, but that happens all the time&#8230;)</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>AT&#038;T&#8217;s Baby Steps</font></p>
<p>Monday, Dec. 6 &#8212;</p>
<p>AT&#038;T says it&#8217;ll be <a href="http://www.sjmercury.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/016659.htm">a little more open</a> to other Internet service providers on its cable systems &#8212; someday.</p>
<p>This is a mini-announcement. It goes barely beyond the telecommunications giant&#8217;s previous statements on open access. And if you read the statement carefully, you see it&#8217;s little more than a vague promise, though it does go in the right direction.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the media are reporting this as if it meant more than it actually does. The cable companies should be required to sell bandwidth to alternative ISPs &#8212; at the same cost they sell it to their captive ISPs &#8212; just as telephone companies must do with their wires. Don&#8217;t hold your breath on this one, though.</p>

				<p>Sunday, Dec. 5 &#8212;</p>
<p>I &#8216;ve decided to celebrate the Millennium when it actually changes &#8212; a year and (almost) a month from now, not midnight on Dec. 31, 1999. I explain why in <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/special/mill/y2kprep/dg120599.htm">my Sunday column</a>, part of the Mercury News&#8217; <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/special/mill/y2kprep/">Y2K special coverage</a>.</p>
<p><b>UPDATE</b><br />
<blockquote> I also suggested in the column that the Internet might be subject to a relatively early test of Y2K problems  because of the way Unix records time. That prompted an <a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/stories/storyReader$152">intriguing addendum</a> from <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cookbook/author.html">Tom Christiansen</a>, who&#8217;s well-known in the Internet development community as an author, lecturer and all-around expert on the Perl programming language. (Caution: His reply is fairly technical.) </p></blockquote>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>More on the &#8220;Shortage&#8221; of Programmers and Other Tech Workers</font></p>
<p>An e-mail correspondent points out this <a href="http://207.178.22.52/articles/currents/009.html">strong opinion piece</a> on a hugely contentious labor issue. It&#8217;s from <a href="http://207.178.22.52/index.html">Linux Journal</a>.</p>
<p>I still say the employers who want to bring in lots of foreign workers should be pushing for laws giving green cards to anyone who qualifies for an H-1B visa. That would let foreign tech workers shop their skills around rather than being bound to one employer. Then we&#8217;d see how bad the shortage really is.</p>

				<p>Friday, Dec. 3 &#8212;</p>
<p><i>A couple of weeks ago, in a short piece looking at the continuing debate over Internet sales taxes, I beat up on Americans for Tax Reform for a press release I believed was incredibly misleading. Here&#8217;s the <a href=" http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/1999/11/17 ">original piece</a>:</i></p>
<p><i>Here&#8217;s a response from Ron Nehring from Americans for Tax Reform:</i> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dan: </p>
<p>I need to take issue with your column.</p>
<p>I did not claim that a $750 TV &#8220;bought online&#8221; would go up to $812 under the NGA plan.</p>
<p>I specifically said that a $750 TV bought on 800.com would go up to $812, because 800.com is located in Oregon, which has no sales tax, and the company has no nexus in any other state.  As a result 800.com collects no sales taxes for any of its sales.  I did not say, nor imply, that no sales taxes are collected anywhere &#8220;online.&#8221;  As you already know, and we have repeatedly stated, e-commerce vendors collect sales taxes in states where they have a nexus.  This is a critical distinction which you glossed over in order to paint Americans for Tax Reform as &#8220;twisting the truth beyond recognition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the NGA plan, every consumer would ultimately pay sales taxes at the time of the sale for every tangible good sold.  That means that the price paid at the time of purchase for the TV in question WOULD go from $750 to $812 (for a New Yorker, as I am, paying 8 1/2% sales tax).  What I stated in our news release was accurate, and relevant.  I suggest you visit 800.com and note that the company prominently states on its website that its sales are free of sales tax collection.</p>
<p>Finally, despite the fact that the information in the release was accurate, you rely on something that you claim is &#8220;implied&#8221; in order to justify your conclusion that it &#8220;twist[ed] the truth beyond recognition.&#8221;  That is just a non sequitir.  It might be justified if I claimed that any good bought online today is free of sales tax, but I did not say that at all.  Go back and read the release.  It is you who has twisted the truth, not us.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t agree with what we&#8217;re fighting for, that&#8217;s fine.  And if you want to use your column as a sounding board for the politicians at the NGA, that&#8217;s fine too.  But on a complicated issue like e-commerce taxation, it is just plain wrong for you to gloss over critical differences in order to paint someone as dishonest.</p></blockquote>
<p><i>And here&#8217;s my response:</i></p>
<p>Your headline on the release makes no distinctions about Oregon or anywhere else, for one thing. It shouts: &#8220;Plan makes a $749 TV cost $812&#8230;&#8221; &#8212; and if that&#8217;s not designed to make a reader worry about his next TV costing more, wherever he buys it, then I&#8217;m George W. Bush.</p>
<p>Your example, using 800.com, makes no mention of where the store is located, or that it&#8217;s one of the few states that doesn&#8217;t charge a sales tax. You only told me that when I took issue with the implication of this.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t change the fundamental point, however: We are encouraging people to shop from merchants that do not apply sales taxes, even if they&#8217;re in states (which is most of them) that rely on such taxes.  Andit&#8217;s going to undermine the tax base. I realize you want that to happen. I don&#8217;t mind if we do away with sales taxes but I would like us to think about the implications before we do it this way.</p>
<p><i>To which he replied:</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you know, headlines, or grabbers, are always intended to get the reader to read the rest of the document.  The claim made in the headline is justified in the press release itself.  It did not &#8220;twist the truth beyondrecognition,&#8221; as you claimed.</p>
<p>Further, 800.com is a commonly used example when discussing the sales tax issue.  In fact, the Wall Street Journal mentioned the company for illustrative purposes in an editorial several months ago, and the company president continues to make the rounds on talk radio discussing his site and the implications of a sales tax collection system.</p>
<p>The fact that 800.com is located in Oregon, or in any state without a sales tax, is only slightly relevant.  Any company with nexus in only one state can be compelled to collect sales tax in a maximum of that one state under current law.  Hence, if 800.com were located in Washington State and only had nexus in that state, purchasers located in 49 other states would not be compelled to pay sales tax at the time of the purchase.  Under the NGA plan, purchasers in 44 states would ultimately be required to pay sales tax on purchasers in 44 states would ultimately be required to pay sales tax on their online purchases.  This would increase the cost to consumers by between 3% and 11%, PLUS the fees paid to the Trusted Third Parties, and the incentives used to induce companies to join the new system.  People are annoyed enough already by ATM fees.  How do you think they will respond to a per-transaction fee of $1 or $2 on their purchases, in addition to sales taxes?  Perhaps a San Francisco-style initiative to ban such schemes?</p>
<p>Further, if you plan to objectively report on this issue, I suggest you scrutinize the NGA&#8217;s claims that a tax-free Internet will result in &#8220;FEWER TEACHERS, AND LESS LAW ENFORCEMENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES,&#8221; as one NGA release claimed.  What a ridiculous example of alarmist rhetoric.  State and local governments are struggling with huge surpluses, not deficits caused by the vaunted &#8220;hollowing out&#8221; of sales tax revenue.  Of course, your column failed to mention that either.</p></blockquote>
<p><i>My response:</i></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have to disagree on whether the headline is justified by the press release. I think it&#8217;s grossly misleading.</p>
<p>800.com may be a &#8220;commonly used example,&#8221; but it was a new one to me &#8212; and I&#8217;ve followed this issue closely. A Wall Street Journal editorial page plus some talk-radio shows aren&#8217;t exactly the stuff of a <i>cause celebre</i>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t dispute that the current law allows retailers to not charge sales taxes in other states unless they have a business &#8220;nexus&#8221; in those states. Nor do I dispute that the NGA plan raises huge questions &#8212; and I would not support it as currently structured. But that doesn&#8217;t make the issue irrelevant.</p>
<p>Is the NGA claim alarmist? You bet. Is the potential problem small? No. Favoring online businesses at the expense of Main Street businesses is a recipe for undermining Main Streets. It won&#8217;t happen immediately, or completely, but a bias in the tax code does make a difference. And ultimately it will erode revenues in a noticeable way. An economic boom masks all kinds of structural shifts. But when the business cycle turns down, as it always does at some point, these issues will no longer be abstract to states and communities that depend on sales tax revenues.</p>
<p>States that charge sales taxes typically have &#8220;use taxes&#8221; &#8212; in the same amount as their state sales taxes &#8212; that consumers are supposed to pay on goods they order from out-of-state. The enforcement of use taxes is at best limited, largely, I&#8217;m sure, because doing so is incredibly intrusive. But if Mr. Nehring and his ideological partners get their way, the the states will not sit still &#8212; and I hate to imagine the result.</p>
<p>The bottom line remains the same: Should we use the tax code to favor one kind of retailer at the expense of other kinds of retailers? I say no.</p>

				<p>Thursday, Dec. 2 &#8212;</p>
<p>If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, what is <a href="http://www.yiffy.com/siliconvalley/africa.html">parody</a>?</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>GOP Likes Computers in Schools</font></p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/placeholder.png" orig-SRC="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/picture$148" align="left" ALT="Photo: Trent Lott"></a></p>
<p>Thursday, Dec. 2 &#8212;</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), the Senate Majority Leader, and several of his colleagues turned up in Silicon Valley Thursday for a show-and-tell at a local elementary school. They were visiting at the behest of various groups including <a href="http://www.technet.org">TechNet</a>, a tech industry lobbying arm, to promote a new program to put computers in schools &#8212; and, of course, to push the Republican political agenda. (They were also wearing dark suits, unusual garb around here.)</p>
<p>One of the sponsors of the program is America Online, which was naturally on all of the screens of the 21 new Gateway computers (Gateway&#8217;s another sponsor) donated to the school under the <a href="http://www.powerup.org">PowerUP program</a>. The AOL screen was plastered with advertising. An online toy store was on several of the AOL sites I saw the children viewing &#8212; just what kids need to be seeing during their school days.</p>
<p>But hey, they get to use computers, so boiling their brains in advertising is just fine, right?</p>
<p>Speaking of commercials, here&#8217;s a depressing sidelight to the event. The organizers stationed three children at the door. The kids were handing out PowerBar snacks. PowerBar (you&#8217;re way ahead of me) is a PowerUP sponsor, too.</p>
<p>Anything that helps kids is good. Let&#8217;s be clear on that. Let&#8217;s also be clear that many public schools in this country are dysfunctional and failing our kids &#8212; though this is emphatically not the case at the exemplary Holly Oak Elementary in San Jose, the school the pols visited.</p>
<p>Computers in schools are useful, but not the only answer. Nor are right-wing jihads, fulsomely supported by Lott and his compatriots, to promote religious and private schools. Ultimately this will come at the expense of public education, notwithstanding PR events like the one on Thursday. Maybe that&#8217;s the right approach, but I don&#8217;t see the same fervency to fix the public schools.</p>
<p>&#8221;This is what it&#8217;s really all about in America,&#8221; Lott said at a Silicon Valley school &#8212; typical in this respect &#8212; where the average teacher doesn&#8217;t make remotely enough money to own a house.</p>

<p>Tuesday, Nov. 30 &#8212;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg113099.htm">why</a>, in my Tuesday Mercury News column.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Media Manipulation</font></p>
<p>Tuesday, Nov. 30 &#8212;</p>
<p>When I go to a technology industry trade show or conference, there&#8217;s usually a  registration booth that says &#8220;Press/Analysts&#8221; or something of that nature. This reflects the fact that journalists and analysts are in essentially the same business: learning about the industry and reporting it to their respective constituencies. In the case of journalists, the audiences are readers, listeners or viewers. Analysts write reports mainly for institutional clients, who sometimes pay a lot of money for their services.</p>
<p>In other words, analysts are journalists for the rich.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cisco.com">Cisco Systems Inc.</a>, the networking company, is holding what it calls an &#8220;Analyst Conference&#8221; on Wednesday, December 1, at the company&#8217;s headquarters in San Jose. Cisco has invited a bunch of journalists, too.</p>
<p>I was among the latter. But I received an e-mail saying that most of the sessions at the daylong meeting would be off the record &#8212; that is, I could not report what company executives said. I can live with that, I said to a Cisco public-relations person, but what about the analysts? Is it off the record for them, too? Here was the response:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><i>You make a valid point. It&#8217;s a tough call for us. This analyst conference is really put on for the analysts by our analyst relations folks. We in public relations ask permission to invite a limited number of reporters to the conference as an educational opportunity for them and agree to make the condition that it is off the record to the press in the sessions you point out.</p>
<p>We hope there is some benefit to journalists despite the off the record conditions in several of the sessions.</p>
<p>Yours is a good question and I respect it. Even if you don&#8217;t agree with the answer here, I hope you can understand how we&#8217;re trying to accomodate different folks.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: It&#8217;s off the record for journalists. It&#8217;s on the record for analysts. I declined to participate in this charade. Instead, I&#8217;ll head up to Menlo Park for an on-the-record briefing with Sun Microsystems.</p>
<p>Cisco has become one of the tech industry&#8217;s most cynical and manipulative companies when it comes to dealing with the media. This befits its size, I suppose, but it doesn&#8217;t fit the image the company wants to project.</p>

<p>Welcome to the FBI&#8217;s latest <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/11/23/1712222&#038;mode=nocomment">&#8220;Geek Profile&#8221;</a> &#8212; as documented by <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>&#8216;s Jon Katz. This profile is a grab-bag of traits designed to catch high-school kids (usually boys) who may be dangerous. Above-average intelligence is one such trait.</p>
<p>&#8220;The FBI&#8217;s checklist is as revealing for what it doesn&#8217;t say as for what it does,&#8221; Katz notes. &#8220;Bullies and predators who prey on kids who are different or &#8220;non-normal&#8221; aren&#8217;t considered dangerous, nor are teachers and educators who preside over uncreative, hostile and, to many kids, suffocating classroom environments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Read this and scream.</p>

<p><font size=4>My Airplane Reading</font></p>
<p>Monday, Nov. 29 &#8212;</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m back in California. The ride from <a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/1999/11/27">Hong Kong</a> was much smoother than the outbound trip.</p>
<p>My favorite part of air travel is the time it gives me for uninterrupted reading. I finished reading one book, a paperback thriller I&#8217;ve already forgotten, and got well into another. I can highly recommend the latter if you like a certain genre of novel.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.resurrectionday.com/home/home.htm">&#8220;Resurrection Day&#8221;</a> (Penguin Putnam Books), by Brendan DuBois, is a what-if alternative history. It&#8217;s set in 1972, ten years after the Cuban missile crisis turned into a nuclear war that destroyed part of the United States and virtually all of the Soviet Union. The plot is a detective story (except that the detective is a newspaper reporter).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve read Robert Harris&#8217; &#8220;Fatherland,&#8221; where the detective in post-World War II Nazi Germany (Hitler didn&#8217;t lose in this book) is a policeman, you&#8217;ll probably want to read &#8220;Resurrection Day,&#8221; too.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Manila</font></p>
<p>Manila, part of the brand-new <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/changes/61">Frontier 6.1</a> from UserLand Software, is the software we&#8217;re using to run this site. The idea behind Manila is that we should be able to write and edit on the Web, for the Web.</p>
<p>This is a big change, and a trend that&#8217;s barely in its infancy. The writing tools are crude, but the concept is powerful.</p>
