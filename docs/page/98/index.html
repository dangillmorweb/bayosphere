				<p>The persecution and long imprisonment of Wen Ho Lee, <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/headline2/039552.htm">who was freed today</a> after pleading guilty under outrageous duress to a felony count, is a dismal chapter in American history.</p>
<p>The judge&#8217;s remarks, upbrading the government for &#8220;embarrassing our entire nation,&#8221; were right on point.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Even Sleazeballs Deserve Free Speech</font> </p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s top weblog piece, regarding the Federal Trade Commission&#8217;s report on how the entertainment industry deliberately aims violence at kids, provoked some comments that led me to think further about the subject. There&#8217;s a serious free-speech issue brewing here.</p>
<p>More in my <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg091300.htm">Wednesday column</a>. </p>

<p><font size=4>AOL Under Pressure</font> </p>
<p>Wall Street Journal: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/459209.asp">FCC: AOL should open messaging to rivals in Time Warner deal</a>. <i>Under one of the FCC staff proposals, AOL would have to open its instant-messaging service to users of other messaging services either six months after FCC approval of the merger or as soon as AOL enables the two separate instant-message services it now operates, AOL Instant Messenger and ICQ, to interact, whichever occurs first, people who have been briefed on the proposals said.</i><br />
<blockquote>This is a positive development. AOL&#8217;s foot-dragging on finding ways to interoperate is getting tiresome. Instant messaging is becoming one of the primary communications methods, and AOL has absolute market dominance. Other instant-messaging services have agreed to interoperate. It&#8217;s time for AOL to stop claiming it also wants to interoperate and show some good faith.</p></blockquote>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>AT&#038;T&#8217;s Head Fake</font> </p>
<p>Washington Post: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A51778-2000Sep11.html">AT&#038;T Rethinks Pledge to Divest</a>. <i>Three months after agreeing to sell off substantial assets in order to gain federal approval for its purchase of cable television giantMediaOne Group, AT&#038;T Corp. is lobbying for last-minute congressional legislation that could relieve it of the burden to sell.</i><br />
<blockquote>After the 1996 Telecom &#8220;reform&#8221; law was enacted, SBC, one of the big regional phone monopolies, which had agreed to the bill in long negotiations, challenged it in court. Bad faith seems to be SOP for the telecommunications industry.</p></blockquote>

				<p>No one with a brain will be surprised by the confirmation that the movie, game and music industries <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/local/center/ads091200.htm">deliberately peddle violence-filled entertainment to children</a> (Mercury News), as a new <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2000/09/youthviol.htm">Federal Trade Commission report</a> makes clear. But the predictable responses from all sides are not especially helpful. </p>
<p>Government mutterings about regulating or even censoring offensive material are just as outrageous as the violent garbage itself. Parents know about the rating systems, the report notes, and they&#8217;re largely satisfied with the ratings.</p>
<p>Jack Valenti, the film industry&#8217;s mouthpiece, told the Washington Post that if violent entertainment led to crime, the crime rate should be going up. But it&#8217;s been heading down steadily during the past generation.</p>
<p>Valenti is correct, but he&#8217;s not right in several ways. First, he implictly assumes that other factors have nothing to do with the lower crime rate. That&#8217;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Worse, he continues to defend what is plainly indefensible on moral grounds. There is no redeeming value of any kind in the toxic sludge that passes for entertainment in some cases. None. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s legal, and it should stay legal. Censorship is worse than what it would prevent.</p>
<p>But Hollywood&#8217;s powers-that-be, caught in their lies &#8212; reminiscent of the tobacco industry&#8217;s claims that it wasn&#8217;t aiming at teenagers &#8212; are showing again that shame is a foreign concept in their executive suites. They make me sick.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>World Intellectual Piracy Organization</font> </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit heavy-handed, but the <a href="http://www.wipo.org.uk">&#8220;World Intellectual Piracy Organization&#8221;</a> is making a real point about the increasingly dismaying policies of the World Intellectual Property Organization. </p>
<p>The latter, known as <a href="http://www.wipo.org">WIPO</a>, is routinely taking domain names away from people at the behest of big companies and powerful people. I noted this trend, disapprovingly, in a <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg082700.htm">recent column</a>.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been having a lot of fun seeing just how portable I can get with my journalism. Pretty darn portable, it turns out &#8212; I can now write my column, using a full-sized keyboard and decent screen, with gear that fits in my pockets and doesn&#8217;t require a telephone land line.</p>
<p>More in my <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg082300.htm">Wednesday column</a>.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Microsoft Speeds Ahead on Chips&#8230; </font> </p>
<p>San Jose Mercury News: <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/top/docs/ms082300.htm">Microsoft to unveil a chip for Net, TV</a>. <i>The chip, set to make its debut this fall, will control the forthcoming version of WebTV&#8217;s interactive television service. But the chip can also be used to power other next-generation devices and services over the Web.</i><br />
<blockquote>Microsoft has always proclaimed itself loudly to be a &#8220;software company&#8221; &#8212; but its hardware forays have not been exactly invisible, WebTV being the most important example. Keep in mind, though, that the company will also be branding its upcoming <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2541786,00.html">X-Box game machine</a> (ZDNet), which has been announced to great fanfare but remains in the vapor category as an actual product.</p>
<p>The news that Microsoft is developing its own microprocessors may suggest a widening rift between the software company and Intel. The two have been drifting apart for years on various matters. Still, the companies remain joined at the hip on other, bigger issues.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s still intriguing to see Microsoft moving so strongly into the next generation of devices on the hardware side. This is an important event.</p></blockquote>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>&#8230;and Stalls on Antitrust </font> </p>
<p>Our favorite monopolist is using the legal system to the utmost, as is its right. But the company&#8217;s ongoing hypocrisy is nauseating.</p>
<p>In its latest ploy, Microsoft filed yet another brief insisting that the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/reuters/docs/334676l.htm">should not immediately hear the antitrust case</a> (Reuters). &#8220;The benefits of comprehensive review by the court of appeals far outweigh whatever time, if any, might be saved by direct review in this Court,&#8221; Microsoft said in its <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/trial/appeals/08-22screply.asp">legal brief</a>, which it filed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Microsoft is making at least two erroneous assumptions here. First, it suggests that the Supreme Court justices are not competent to understand the issues unless the Appeals Court hands the case up in neatly tied package. The Supreme Court may be collectively too lazy, but these folks are not stupid.</p>
<p>Second, the trial court produced a voluminous record of testimony and exhibits. The legal issues were squarely joined by both sides. Judge Jackson ruled, and his ruling is what&#8217;s at issue here. The Supreme Court, if it does its job, will end up reviewing the record whether or not the Appeals Court does it first.</p>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s hypocrisy has been on display from the start. It has repeatedly said how important this case is, and how vital it will be to get it settled &#8212; presumably so the world can go on with monopolistic business as usual. Once it got Jackson to issue a stay of his ruling, all of that ardor for resolution melted away like ice on hot pavement. Surprised? Only if you don&#8217;t pay attention.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>The Register: <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/12736.html">AltaVista admits service a sham</a>. <i>No one at AltaVista was available to comment on how something that doesn&#8217;t exist could be put on hold.</i><br />
<blockquote>See also <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/449329.asp">Search nets no AltaVista customers; portal halts unfeasible access plan</a> (Wall Street Journal).</p></blockquote>
<p>Is &#8220;scandal&#8221; too strong a word for what Alta Vista has been pulling here? Is &#8220;lazy&#8221; too weak a word for the way the press in the United Kingdom echoed &#8212; and hyped &#8212; Alta Vista&#8217;s claims that it was offering an unmetered Internet access service?</p>
<p>Not all reporters were failing to do their jobs. The truth emerged when <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk">The Register</a>, a wonderful online technology publication based in London, and several other media organizations started asking where the customers were.</p>
<p>The technology business is famous for this kind of thing &#8212; announcing products that appear late, if ever, and treating customers as if they were stupid. But the technology leaders are the new Masters of the Universe, and they feel they can get away with anything.</p>
<p>Usually they do. Look at the scandal &#8212; this is the precise word &#8212; of online privacy, or the lack thereof. The industry claims that self-regulation is the solution. Of course it does. Self-regulation is no regulation, by definition. It&#8217;s a lie, a blatant lie. But the tech crowd owns the politicians these days.</p>
<p>The media should push harder. I don&#8217;t agree entirely with <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/08/22/squealWithCare">this essay</a>, entitled &#8220;Squeal With Care,&#8221; by Dave Winer, but he&#8217;s right that journalists aren&#8217;t asking tough enough questions.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Technical Non-Support </font> </p>
<p>If the technology industry were a divorced parent, it could be sued for non-support of its dependents &#8212; the customers.</p>
<p>The latest evidence is Microsoft&#8217;s decision to cut off unlimited tech support for its Office products in favor of Web help. This is yet another example of profiteering at customers&#8217; expense. Microsoft isn&#8217;t the only company that has done this, but it&#8217;s one of the few companies that could easily have afforded to do the right thing. </p>
<p>When you have a monopoly position, as Microsoft does in operating systems and office suites, it&#8217;s easy to do the wrong thing.</p>

				<p>Michael Dell, founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.dell.com">Dell Computer Corp.</a>, was in Silicon Valley yesterday to give the opening keynote speech at the <a href="http://www.linuxworldexpo.com">Linux World</a> Conference and Expo. You read that right.</p>
<p>Dell may be as closely aligned with Microsoft as any company, but Michael Dell is going where his customers go. More in my <a href="http://www.sjmercury.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg081600.htm">Wednesday column</a>.</p>
<p><i>Note, toward the end, that Dell advises the music industry on listening to customers. The music industry should listen to him.</i></p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Speaking of Speaking </font> </p>
<p>I&#8217;m giving a talk at the <a href="http://www.hoti.org/">Hot Interconnects</a> symposium today at Stanford University. The gathering is for high-level engineers and researchers to show off their latest ideas in high-performance chips, software and systems. In other words, the people I&#8217;ll be addressing know way more about technology&#8217;s inner workings than I do. So what can I tell them that might be even slightly interesting?</p>
<p>My talk has three parts:
<li>A reflection on Moore&#8217;s Law and its counterparts in storage and bandwidth. We can easily understand how something might get twice as fast or powerful or dense in a short time, but the compounded effect of this trend is hard to grasp. Not only that, the combined impact of that progress is more than just additive.
<li>Binary choices. Technology is creating some truly yes-or-no choices for us in areas where we once were able to find a middle ground. That includes encryption, intellectual property and other issues that defy compromise.
<li>The intellectual property wars of the emerging era are going to define more of our future than most people appreciate. What&#8217;s going on now is a supremely greedy land grab in every area of IP &#8212; patents, trademarks, copyright and more. The owners of IP are winning almost all of the legal battles, having tamed Congress, but they&#8217;re losing all the technical ones as Napster and other technologies come along. </p>

				<p>Washington Post: <a href="http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25494-2000Aug14.html">Firm Tracking Consumers on Web for Drug Companies</a>. <i>&#8220;In the future, we may develop products and services which collect data that, when used in conjunction with the tracking database, could enable a direct identification of certain individual visitors,&#8221; it says, adding that they would never take advantage of such information.</i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>The pure cynicism of these people is enough to make me throw up. The value of the data grows when it&#8217;s tied to individuals. It&#8217;s not in this company&#8217;s interest to do the right thing &#8212; all of the pressure will be to invade privacy.</p>
<p>When will Congress do something about this? Watch the campaign contributions from the medicine and (legal) drug industries. Privacy isn&#8217;t on the corporate agenda, because it&#8217;s less profitable than invading privacy. So you have to believe it&#8217;ll never really make it onto the government&#8217;s agenda, not in any serious way.</p></blockquote>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Bill 602P </font> </p>
<p>I keep getting panic-filled e-mails warning me that &#8220;Bill 602P will permit the Federal Government to charge a 5-cent charge on every delivered E-mail&#8221; &#8212; despite the fact, which should be well known by now, that <a href="http://www.urbanlegends.com/ulz/emailtax.html">THIS IS A HOAX</a>, as the superb <a href="http://www.urbanlegends.com/">Urban Legends</a> Web site notes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really baffling that people keep falling for this. Or maybe it isn&#8217;t. </p>
<p>The mistrust Americans feel for government is not diminishing despite the robust economy and overall better times in this nation. One reason is that governments continue to do foolish things &#8212; and fail to do sensible things, e.g. passing a law (see item above) to protect our privacy from the data-mining maurauders. So even a ridiculous idea like &#8220;Bill 602P&#8221; wins credence despite its blatant falsehood.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you get an e-mail about Bill 602P or some variant, please do us all a favor. Delete it and let the sender know it&#8217;s a hoax. Thanks.</p>

<p><font size=4>Politics Online </font> </p>
<p>The Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles is proving to be just as vacuous as the recent GOP gathering in Philadelphia, and Web coverage is distinguished by its sameness. (I did watch a tape of President Clinton&#8217;s speech last night, and thought he made a pretty good case for his administration&#8217;s record on the economy.)</p>
<p>The best commentary I&#8217;ve seen about the online convention coverage is from the National Journal: <a href="http://nationaljournal.com/members/news/2000/08/nj081400.27.htm">Internet Avenue: Boulevard Of Broken Sewers</a>. Two excerpts:
<li><i>During GOP convention week, there was a 14 percent drop in traffic at the four most popular online news sites &#8212; MSNBC.com, CNN.com, NYTimes.com, and WashingtonPost.com &#8212; according to a report by the Joan Shorenstein Center at Harvard&#8217;s Kennedy School of Government.</i>
<li><i>The most telling moment was when Esther Dyson, the Internet guru, said we have to stop thinking about the Net as a publishing medium. Publishing goes in one direction, she said, but Net communication goes two ways.</i></p>
<p></i></p></blockquote>
