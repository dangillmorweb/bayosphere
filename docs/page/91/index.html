				<p>Wall Street Journal: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/516394.asp">Rivals of AOL Time Warner face battle with giant, despite curbs</a>. <i>&#8220;AOL Time Warner still has the incentive and the opportunity to play games,&#8221; says Mr. Lessig. &#8220;It will require a continuing strong signal from regulators that certain games will not be tolerated.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>The problem is that AOL is still entirely in the driver&#8217;s seat. It doesn&#8217;t have to open up its instant messaging (IM) system until it offers IM via video. In other words, it can totally consolidate its already-massive dominance in text and, soon, audio messaging &#8212; and then open up only when that is a meaningless concession.</p>
<p>The FCC&#8217;s cave-in to AOL was bad enough, but consider that the two Republican members of the FCC voted to approve the deal with no restrictions at all. They will have a majority soon, and they aren&#8217;t likely to enforce the order their agency just issued. So AOL&#8217;s concessions are likely to turn out meaningless no matter what.</p>
<p>Consumers will not gain as a result of AOL&#8217;s buyout of Time Warner. Only the company&#8217;s shareholders will win, and anyone who thinks otherwise just isn&#8217;t paying attention.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<li>Newsweek: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/515985.asp">AOL&#8217;s &#8216;Transforming Transaction&#8217;</a>. <i>No matter what anyone at the new company says, journalism&#8212;going out and looking for the truth, then presenting it to people&#8212;at AOL Time Warner will be less important than it was at Time Warner.</i></p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>The Hype Worked</font> </p>
<p>Reuters: <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/029108.htm">&#8216;Ginger&#8217; inventor says speculation is far overblown</a>. <i>&#8220;We have a promising project, but nothing of the Earth-shattering nature that people are conjuring up,&#8221; Dean Kamen, president of Manchester, New Hampshire-based DEKA Research, said in a statement referring to one of his forthcoming inventions.</i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Doesn&#8217;t matter. The hype machine has already done its work.</p>
<p>Once again, the media have fallen prey &#8212; like the suckers we can be &#8212; to outrageous and possibly orchestrated hype. Too bad we keep letting this kind of thing happen.</p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>It&#8217;s official. America Online will get to take over Time Warner, now that the <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/ap/docs/836831l.htm">FCC has signed off</a> on the massive buyout.</p>
<p>The FCC&#8217;s approval, like the Federal Trade Commission&#8217;s earlier okay of the deal, came with some conditions. The question now is whether the conditions are useful and, if they are, whether AOL will ultimately honor its side of the deal. I have my doubts in both areas.</p>
<p>AOL Time Warner will be a powerhouse. It will control vast swaths of news and entertainment content, far more than any rival. There&#8217;s still some competition in this arena, anyway.</p>
<p>But AOL will control the way millions of customers view entertainment and information in the Digital Age, notably via cable TV systems that are one of the two most prominent ways Americans will obtain high-speed Internet access. And in its domination of instant-messaging, AOL will hold the key to one of tomorrow&#8217;s primary communications systems. </p>
<p>The FTC and FCC approvals go part of the way toward requiring AOL to make good on its promises not to abuse that power. In particular, the FCC has won AOL&#8217;s commitment to truly make its instant-messaging system interoperable with systems run by Internet rivals. But the conditions, while welcome, will be difficult to enforce &#8212; and they are far too limited. </p>
<p>The FCC only asks AOL to be interoperable with other messaging systems when and if it adds video to its own instant messaging. There&#8217;s no requirement to work with other providers in today&#8217;s text-based systems or, apparently, even a future audio-based operation.</p>
<p>Maybe the Bush administration&#8217;s appointees to the regulatory agencies will decide not to enforce the Clinton-era deals, anyway. That kind of thing has happened before.</p>
<p>Ultimately, even if you believe the Bush people will enforce the agreements, you should be wary of AOL&#8217;s intentions. The company has such overwhelming power and has already shown a willingness to abuse it. Its cynical stalling on making its instant-messaging system interoperable is the action of a company that understands &#8212; and plans to hang onto &#8212; the enormous value of its dominance.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>The States Go to Work</font> </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reports today that 20 states are <a href="http://interactive.wsj.com/articles/SB979171021860248204.htm">opposing Orbitz</a> (paid registration required to read this story), an <a href="http://www.orbitz.com/">online joint venture</a> of major airlines. Leading the charge are the people who are going to take the consumer-protection lead in the next few years.</p>
<p>They are the state attorneys general, and they&#8217;re worried about Orbitz because of its enormous potential for collusion among the major carriers. Keep in mind that the airlines have a history of playing games with fares, including the infamous &#8212; and taped &#8212; offer a few years ago by one airline head to raise fares as soon as another carrier did so.</p>
<p>Good for the attorneys general. Online reservations are terrific. But this particular system looks anticompetitive.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Rupert Murdoch, Right Wing Hero, Versus Family Values </font> </p>
<p>It never comes as a surprise anymore that Fox Television, which lives on slimy programming, has created yet another gutter-dwelling show. The latest is Temptation Island, which the Washington Post notes is <a href="http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46313-2001Jan11.html">not worth watching</a> even if you&#8217;re a voyeur.</p>
<p>The premise for this garbage is that you collect four supposedly devoted couples at a resort and hire a bunch of willing single people to tempt them to stray from their supposed monogamy. Now that&#8217;s family values for you.</p>
<p>It would be less nauseating if <a href="http://www.csun.edu/~kab42291/">Rupert Murdoch</a>, the corporate media baron who runs News Corp., which owns Fox TV, weren&#8217;t such a right-wing maven. As hypocrites go, he&#8217;s in the top rank.</p>

<p><font size=4>California Power Woes</font> </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.caiso.com/SystemStatus.html">Calfornia Independent System Operator</a> has declared a Stage Three alert today. This means rolling blackouts are a real possibility.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear that Californians understand just how bad the energy situation has become. It&#8217;s utterly plain that east of the Rockies there&#8217;s almost no comprehension &#8212; except at the highest levels of government.</p>
<p>When you see <a href="http://cgi.mercurycenter.com/premium/local/docs/davis10.htm">emergency meetings</a> that include the U.S. secretary of the treasury, you begin to grasp that the nation is on the brink of major-league trouble. The people in charge got us into this disaster. Let&#8217;s see if they have the ability to help us out.</p>

				<p>AP: <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/025005.htm">New notebooks, more megahertz, delayed OS</a>. <i>Jobs unveiled a new software program called iDVD that will allow users to make their own DVD movies. Another new program called iTunes will let users burn MP3-format songs onto CDs in a simple and user-friendly interface.</i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Not much huge news at Steve Jobs&#8217; Macworld Expo keynote, it turns out. An interesting new DVD-creation app. Faster desktop models. New notebooks. Another delay in Mac OS X.</p>
<p>You know what? It&#8217;s still enough to energize the Macolytes.</p>
<p>The latest <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">PowerBook models</a> are the most interesting announcement. Apple *still* refuses to put out a true sub-notebook on the order of IBM&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pc.ibm.com/us/thinkpad/xseries/index.html">X series Thinkpads</a> or the Sony <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/vaio/notebooks_z505.htm">SuperSlim Vaio models</a> &#8212; the kind you can actually use with reasonable comfort when you&#8217;re flying in coach. Still, the new Apple notebooks are a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Delaying the release of OS X is actually a smart move. After waiting this long, Apple might as well wait a little longer and try to get it right.</p>
<p>I expect to buy one more Mac, for my music. After that, I&#8217;m doubting whether it&#8217;ll be worth staying on the platform. Hope I&#8217;m wrong.</p></blockquote>

<p><font size=4>AOL&#8217;s Instant Messaging Deception</font> </p>
<p>Washington Post: <a href="http://www.washtech.com/news/regulation/6469-1.html">Pop-up Profit for AOL</a>. <i>In recent months, AOL has transformed the product that first caught on with teenagers as a way to trade quick messages into a money-making enterprise &#8212; raising new questions about whether AOL has a financial incentive to use its current dominant position in instant messaging to unfairly thwart competitors.</i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Doh.</p>
<p>Raising questions? There&#8217;s never been even a slight doubt that AOL intended to make money on messaging. The advertising potential alone was blatantly obvious.</p>
<p>So was the potential for owning the world&#8217;s greatest directory of computer users &#8212; the IM equivalent of a phone book. Freeze out the competition, as AOL has been doing, and you have essentially unlimited potential to make a business.</p>
<p>Smart people run AOL. They completely understand what they have in their dominance of instant messaging. Too bad the government regulators, charged with protecting competition, do not.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m in Las Vegas for the annual <a href="http://www.cesweb.org">Consumer Electronics Show</a>. A mind-boggling array of gear and ideas fills the convention center and overflow areas. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let you know what I see.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Spectrum Auction, Hide and Seek</font></p>
<p>Wall Street Journal: <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/512021.asp">Small companies&#8217; spectrum auction shows signs of giants&#8217; intrusion</a>. <i>Nine of the top 15 bidders classified as small companies are, in fact, backed by the industry&#8217;s biggest players, including AT&#038;T Corp., Cingular Wireless LLC, Sprint Corp. and VoiceStream Wireless Corp. </i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>In other words, it&#8217;s bogus.</p>
<p>The idea was to give smaller companies the right to bid on the new spectrum. But as always happens in such situations, such as minority contracting, many of the supposed small fry are not much more than fronts for big fish.</p>
<p>Why not do it honestly from the beginning?</p></blockquote>

				<p>Mercury News: <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/top/docs/fed010401.htm"> Fed&#8217;s move lifts markets, raises concern</a>. <i> &#8220;It&#8217;s not going to suddenly restore earnings growth to where it was six months ago,&#8221; said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International in New York. &#8220;The economy is still going to stay soggy.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Investors&#8217; immediate reaction to yesterday&#8217;s Federal Reserve rate cut was scarier than the economic considerations that prompted the Fed to act, though today&#8217;s slight pullback in the markets showed some collective sanity. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the worry. Some people seem unwilling to accept the plain truth that the growth of the past few years has been due, in part, to unwarranted market enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The euphoria that fueled the NASDAQ and, to a lesser degree, the DJIA was based on the technology mania, particularly the dot-con game that blew up in investors&#8217; faces last year. We should not want to restore that same fervor. We should want to prevent it from happening again.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that enthusiasm for the benefits of technology is unwarranted. The benefits are becoming clearer every day. The boom added value to many parts of the economy due to the tech infrastructure investments, if nothing else. Technology investments are still a good long-range strategy, moreover, provided investors are realistic.</p>
<p>Nor am I saying that we should do nothing amid signs that a deep recession could take hold. Lower interest rates, moreover, could help curb the ardor for the massive tax  cut favored by George W. Bush and his ideological allies &#8212; a dangerous move that would return the U.S. to fiscally unsound policies and present a much worse danger to the nation&#8217;s, and world&#8217;s, long-term economic future.</p>
<p>Investors are insane if they think they can return to the days when it seemed like practically any technology company would double in value in short order. If that does turn out to be true, even briefly, it will only precipitate a market meltdown that will make last year&#8217;s troubles seem tame.</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s scary.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dave Winer: <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2001/01/04/desktopWebsites">Desktop Websites</a>. <i>Like Desktop Publishing (DTP) of the 1980s, more of the Web of 2001 will reside on your hard drive, using the CPU cycles of your machine, not on a machine purchased by investors. DTP put new power in the hands of users, and Desktop Websites do that too.</i></p>

				<p>David Coursey (ZDNet): <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/comment/0,5859,2669714,00.html">Do Apple&#8217;s megahertz matter?</a>. <i>Of all the reasons to buy or not to buy a Mac, the difference between a 500 MHz G4 and a 750 MHz Pentium should be well down the list.</i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Apple&#8217;s problems are well-known enough now, but Coursey is right on this issue. Consumers who buy because of clock speed are utterly missing the point.</p>
<p>Of course, we in the media have played up clock speed for so long that consumers are forgiven for being somewhat confused. But when someone is buying a new computer, it&#8217;s mostly the other things that should count &#8212; and we need to make that clearer.</p></blockquote>

<p><font size=4>Consumer Electronics Show </font> </p>
<p>I&#8217;m heading to the annual <a href="http://www.cesweb.org">Consumer Electronics Show</a> in Las Vegas tomorrow. It&#8217;s interesting that the two main keynote speakers will be Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, and Craig Barrett, CEO at Intel. </p>
<p>This should tell Apple&#8217;s management something. It probably won&#8217;t.</p>

				<p>Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s great film, &#8220;2001: A Space Odyssey,&#8221; remains one of my favorites. It&#8217;s also one of the cultural icons that has been at the core of my thinking since I first saw it more than three decades ago.</p>

<p><font size=4>Yahoo Caves Under Pressure </font></p>
<p>Mercury News: <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/front/docs/yahoo010301.htm">Yahoo bans auctions of Nazi memorabilia, other hate items</a>. <i>Although Yahoo said its decision to remove hate-related items from its auction site was not made because of the French case, the decision still could have implications for the case that is being closely watched by free-speech and Internet-rights advocates.</i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Raise your hand if you believe this had nothing to do with the French case, where Yahoo had been ordered to keep French Web users from accessing the auction items in question. No hands? I thought not.</p>
<p>The Nazi memorabilia may have been disgusting. It offends me, so I don&#8217;t look at it. </p>
<p>But Yahoo&#8217;s lack of backbone is disgraceful for an outfit that claims to be a media company. This move is a flagrant cave-in to a bullying government, and a foreign one at that.</p>
<p>What will Yahoo do when the French or Germans come back to the trough, demanding that the company pull from its discussion boards any postings that praise the Nazis or some other offensive material? Here&#8217;s betting that Yahoo will find some unbelievable reason to comply even as it pretends it&#8217;s sticking up for free speech.</p>
<p>A sad day.</p></blockquote>
