<p>In about an hour, Jay Harris (above right) and I will be joining a panel discussion here on the topic of &#8220;New Media and Democracy: Technology in Changing Societies.&#8221; I&#8217;ll be discussing overall tech trends and then applying them to the future of journalism.
</p>
<p>In this picture, Jay is talking with Jerelyn Eddings, director of the <a href="http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=3939">Freedom Forum African Center</a>, which has brought me here and is putting on this program. Behind them is Jay&#8217;s wife, Christine.
</p>
<p>Talking with journalists here reminds me how protected American journalists are. I spoke with a writer who is living here, exiled from his home in Kenya, where the government has put out an arrest warrant on him because he&#8217;s exposed official misdeeds.
</p>
<p>Leaving the U.S. is always good for perspective.

<p>The <a href="http://www.parks-nw.co.za/pilanesberg/">Pilanesberg National Park</a>, some 500 square kilometers, is astonishing. Way better than my photography&#8230;
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been having severe problems with Internet connections the past couple of days, and am heading to places where the problems may get even worse. Don&#8217;t look for many updates in the next couple of days.
</p>
<p>By the way, if you use America Online on a Windows 2000 computer, don&#8217;t bother to try to use it in many countries outside the United States. I signed up for one of those $5 a month accounts so I&#8217;d be able to get online in some countries not supported by my global roaming ISP. I&#8217;ve learned the hard way that AOL on Windows 2000 is incompatible with some partner networks in foreign countries. Of course, AOL doesn&#8217;t tell its customers about this little detail. There&#8217;s not a hint of it in the AOL help files or its Web site. You only find out you&#8217;re screwed &#8211; a little late &#8212; when you call the U.S. for technical help. (The &#8220;customer services&#8221; person at AOL was not only not apologetic, but outright indifferent. Surprised?)

				<p>AP: <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/docs/hottopics/microsoft/020758.htm">DOJ Won&#8217;t Pursue Microsoft Breakup</a>.
</p>
<p>Bad, bad, bad news for competition. The government has caved in, giving Microsoft all it needs to consolidate its chokehold over the computer industry and extend its brutal authority into more of our lives.
</p>
<p>Foregoing a breakup means that the government leaves itself no serious leverage in the supposed negotiations for a settlement. What incentive does Microsoft have left to behave? None. Hell, why not just drop the case?
</p>
<p>There&#8217;s never been a better case for a breakup than now, particularly in light of Microsoft&#8217;s continued sleazy, anticompetitive behavior in the face of its loss in the courtroom. Yet the people entrusted with protecting competition have chosen to take the easy way out of this case, and they have abandoned the public they&#8217;ve sworn oaths to protect.
</p>
<p>What a disheartening development.

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p><i>Note: This is a revised and much expanded version of yesterday&#8217;s initial take on the topic.</i>
</p>
<p>Competition got hammered Thursday, and all the spin in the world won&#8217;t change that fact.
</p>
<p>     The Justice Department and state attorneys general insist that their actions &#8212; to <a href="http://http://www.siliconvalley.com/docs/opinion/dgillmor/dg090701.htm">abandon a breakup of Microsoft and give up on a key legal question</a> &#8212; are sound strategic maneuvers. Maybe they even believe what they&#8217;re saying.
</p>
<p>     Some will charge that money bought this new position. I doubt campaign contributions &#8212; the legal bribery that fuels government today &#8212; were the direct cause.
</p>
<p>     For the Bush administration, which has a consistent record of favoring the interests of big business, this was a no-brainer. The only surprise was the charade we&#8217;d been seeing from the Bush Justice Department in this matter. Now we know what we suspected. It was a pretense.
</p>
<p>      The real surprise, and disappointment, was the states&#8217; willingness to go along with this sellout. My guess is that the attorneys general have grown weary of the battle. They&#8217;ve fallen victim to Microsoft&#8217;s ability and willingness to outlast and outspend any opponent.
</p>
<p>     The case for splitting up this unrepentant monopolist has only grown stronger since the trial, not weaker. Microsoft has been spitting on the legal system and, with Windows XP and other initiatives, maneuvering without any subtlety to extend its monopoly into new arenas.
</p>
<p>     Giving up on the &#8220;tying&#8221; claim didn&#8217;t help, either. It tells the world that Microsoft had a right to bolt the Internet Explorer Web browser to the Windows operating system even though the primary purpose was to kill competition.
</p>
<p>     The government retreated without even a hint of a concession from the most arrogant monopolist since Standard Oil. In the process, the Justice Department and its state-government go-alongs have left themselves no serious leverage in the supposed negotiations for a settlement.
</p>
<p>     They seem to think they can move the case along more quickly now, and get serious remedies affecting Microsoft&#8217;s conduct. What are they smoking? Haven&#8217;t they noticed that Microsoft doesn&#8217;t believe in anything but a legal scorched-earth strategy? Haven&#8217;t they observed Microsoft&#8217;s ability to string the case out endlessly, until remedies for yesterday&#8217;s conduct are meaningless in today&#8217;s &#8212; and tomorrow&#8217;s &#8212; reality?
</p>
<p>     Microsoft has shown it will not agree to any remedies that mean actual change in conduct or any remedies that risk the monopoly and its extension. It has shown it will violate the spirit of any agreement it makes if that suits the corporate objectives.
</p>
<p>      The Justice Department claims it doesn&#8217;t want remedies that require endless government intervention in the inner workings of technology development. If the government pursues the case in the way it now says it will go, such intervention will be unavoidable.
</p>
<p>     A breakup &#8212; a so-called structural remedy &#8212; would have been a relatively clean solution. Conduct remedies, if adopted, will amount to a new federal Department of Software Design.
</p>
<p>     The spin will continue, but the reality is simple. The people whose job is to protect competitive markets have given ground on fundamental principles. They&#8217;re looking for an easy way out. There isn&#8217;t one.
</p>
<blockquote><p>UPDATE: It&#8217;s morning in South Africa. I&#8217;ve slept on this column, and have scanned the Web for other folks&#8217; take on the subject. I think Dave Winer is probably right when he says that the move is <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/09/06">a prelude to an orchestrated settlement</a>, and that the settlement will not help protect competition.</p></blockquote>

				<p>A few months ago, following a meeting held by <a href="http://www.pfir.org">People for Internet Responsibility</a>, I suggested that the Internet <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/docs/opinion/dgillmor/dg050901.htm">needed a &#8220;fact squad&#8221;</a> to counter all the lies spewing from government, big business and other entities that want to control our lives.
</p>
<p>Well, it looks like this may actually happen. PFIR just put up a <a href="http://www.factsquad.org/">FactSquad.org</a> Web site. Its mission is to provide &#8220;a new resource for information regarding technology and its effects on society, dedicated to cutting through the self-serving hype, spin, misinformation, and propaganda that all too often is fed to media, politicians, business leaders, and the citizens of the world regarding technological issues.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t much on the site at the moment. Needless to say, however, I hope this project will take root.

				<p>Call it a &#8220;Hail Carly&#8221; play.
</p>
<p>When one beleaguered giant buys another, you can smell the desperation. It&#8217;s oozing from the corporate pores at Hewlett-Packard and Compaq with the <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/docs/news/svtop/hp090401.htm">announcement that the HP would buy Compaq</a> in a stock swap.
</p>
<p>The antitrust regulators should let this deal happen with few modifications. In practically every market that has serious potential for long-term profit, even the combined company, despite its new heft, will be an underdog or face heated competition.
</p>
<p>That&#8217;s actually the rosy scenario. It assumes, contrary to the history of big buyouts, that HP can effectively swallow Compaq without major woes. Combining these companies will be complicated, Carly Fiorina, HP&#8217;s chief executive, said with gross understatement on Tuesday.
</p>
<p>When Fiorina told analysts that the combined company will lead the field in consumer technology, her bragging had a hollow sound. It&#8217;s hardly thrilling to be the leader in a market that is dull, nearly devoid of innovation and barely profitable.
</p>
<p>The Intel-compatible PC is a commodity. It&#8217;s controlled not by hardware companies but by Microsoft, which essentially dictates how manufacturers will build the machines and then tells PC makers how the screen will appear to customers. Dell, the most serious competitor in the U.S., innovates almost solely in managing the supply chain.
</p>
<p>Some worry about the fact that the majority of PCs sold in stores today are made by HP and Compaq. But there are other ways and places, which frequently are better alternatives, to buy a home PC. Besides, the barrier to entry in PC manufacturing is not exactly high. You don&#8217;t see new entrants clamoring to join today&#8217;s cutthroat price wars.
<p>In servers, the companies combined will have a significant market share &#8212; large enough that the European regulators will be taking a close look. Yet the lower end of the server market is becoming commoditized, too. At the high end, Sun and IBM are more aggressive than ever.
</p>
<p>Below the PC, in the handheld market, there&#8217;s potential for some interesting developments. Compaq, with its hot-selling iPaq, and HP with its Jornada are increasingly serious competition to the Palm-compatible handhelds.
</p>
<p>Can the bigger HP become a leader in services, recovering momentum there after last fall&#8217;s aborted buyout of PricewaterhouseCoopers? Maybe, but it&#8217;s bizarre to think that a buyout of Compaq is the most efficient way to do this.
</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope HP won&#8217;t find redundancies in the research units of the two companies. There&#8217;s little enough serious research going on anymore in corporate America, but Compaq and HP are doing some of it.
</p>
<p>Wall Street&#8217;s initial reaction, to pummel HP&#8217;s stock, doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean much. The financial community has been spectacularly wrong on just about everything in the past couple of years, after all. These wizards sold us the Internet stock bubble, when anything tech-related was gold, and now are punishing everything with a technology angle &#8212; except monopolies, which the share-buying crowd always likes. One might even interpret the Wall Street response as a signal not to look for any special dominance coming out of this combination.
</p>
<p>Just as likely, the market was placing a no-confidence vote in people. Compaq&#8217;s CEO, Michael Capellas, has ricocheted from strategy to strategy during his tenure, and so has Fiorina during hers. In many ways both executives have been trapped by circumstance, but tough times are when the great leaders emerge.
</p>
<p>Fiorina was never as terrific as her early notices. She&#8217;s not as bad as her current critics say, even if one suspects she&#8217;s been given more time than many other CEOs might have had in the same position. But it&#8217;s increasingly difficult to believe in her as the CEO of a company that plans to rival IBM.
</p>
<p>She was genuinely bold when she tried to buy PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Compaq buyout is more like the hail-Mary pass the quarterback launches on the last play of the game. This deal seems borne more of despair than daring.

				<span class="meta-prep meta-prep-author">Posted on</span> <a href="http://bayosphere.com/2001/09/03/idiotic-tv-show-overshadows-racism-summit/" title="12:01 am" rel="bookmark"><span class="entry-date">September 3, 2001</span></a> <span class="meta-sep">by</span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="http://bayosphere.com/author/dan-gillmor/" title="View all posts by Dan Gillmor">Dan Gillmor</a></span>			</div><!-- .entry-meta -->

				<p>It was probably inevitable that the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/racism/index.htm">World Conference on Racism</a> would devolve into nothing but politics, and evil politics at that. It&#8217;ll continue even though the <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/breaking/headline2/067195.htm">U.S. and Israel have pulled out</a> &#8212; for good reasons, at least in the latter&#8217;s case &#8212; but it won&#8217;t carry the weight it should have.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s being held not far from here, in Durban. I haven&#8217;t heard many people in Johannesburg mention the event, however, apart from journalists.
</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s even being eclipsed on the front pages of some newspapers by the local version of the grotesque <a href="http://www.bigbrothersa.com/">&#8220;Big Brother&#8221;</a> TV program, which started in Holland and is spreading like a disease around the world. A group of 20-something South Africans lives in a wired house, where every movement and word is recorded on camera, and two get tossed out each week.
</p>
<p>One of the participants, it turned out, has a criminal record. The hilarious response of a spokeswoman for the program was, in effect, that the company promoting the show knew about this and that it was perfectly fine. The logic was that having a convicted crook aboard meant a better reflection of society as a whole. What tripe.
</p>
<p>But even the stupidity of the TV show is less foolish, less grotesque, than what a slew of non-governmental organizations did when they claimed that Israel was guilty of genocide. This is a slimy charge, and it undermines the credibility of some otherwise worthwhile groups.  Israel has been guilty of some outrageous acts, but genocide isn&#8217;t even close to truth. I&#8217;m glad to say that <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> and other prominent human-rights groups refused to sign this libel.
</p>
<p>NOTE: Thanks to the BBC&#8217;s <a href="http://www.copydesk.co.uk">Martin Conaghan</a> for correcting me on the country where Big Brother got started. It was Holland, not the U.K.

<p>This is the famous <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/mandela/1997/sp971130.html">Regina Mundi</a> Catholic church in Soweto, South Africa, the black township next to Johannesburg. The church was the site of political meetings during the anti-apartheid revolution here. It&#8217;s also the place where <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/s312426.htm">students fled</a> on June 16, 1978, after police opened fire with live ammunitition to break them up as they gathered to head to a peaceful rally. Two died and 11 were injured, and the racist regime was condemned worldwide.
</p>
<p>Today South Africa is a democracy. There are many, many problems in the society and government, but you get a sense that people still believe in the fundamental goodwill that, almost miraculously, kept their revolution from turning monstrously bloody. I admire these people more than I can describe.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m here for several events &#8212; mostly talks and panels &#8212; including one later this week sponsored by the <a href="http://www.freedomforum.org">Freedom Forum</a>, a journalism foundation based in Washington. Then we head to Grahamstown early next week for the <a href="http://loan.journ.ru.ac.za/custom/index.html">Highway Africa</a> conference, where I&#8217;m on two panels and chairing a third. After that we go to Zambia, where they&#8217;re having an election, for a discussion of technology and democracy. I&#8217;m thrilled that <a href="http://www.poynter.org/offthenews/041201harris.htm">Jay Harris</a>, former publisher of the Mercury news, is a co-panelist at several of these events.
</p>
<p>Look for more reports during the week.
