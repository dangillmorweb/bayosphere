				<p>Today&#8217;s International Herald Tribune is running a New York Times story regarding <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/32758.html">a poll</a> showing that a majority of Americans would be willing to see thousands of innocent civilians die in a military retaliation that also got the people responsible for the Sept. 11 atrocities. I can&#8217;t imagine a better way to create more terrorists.
</p>
<p>Are we really that bloodthirsty? What depressing numbers these are.

<p>I&#8217;m booked out of Frankfurt to San Francisco on an early-afternoon flight today. I can&#8217;t wait to get home.

				<p>Less than an hour before a plane slammed into the World Trade Center, I was standing on the site of a long-ago battle in South Africa. A young man&#8217;s description of that day, upon which pivoted a a century of subsequent history, was an eloquent reminder of something we should never take for granted: freedom.

<p>These people are protesting the trial of Fred M&#8217;membe, editor of the <a href="http://www.zamnet.zm/zamnet/post/post.html">The Post</a>, Zambia&#8217;s leading independent daily newspaper. M&#8217;membe was supposed to be at the Freedom Forum events I&#8217;ve been attending, but by amazing coincidence the government, which loathes him and his paper, set the court dates for these two days. M&#8217;membe and his paper have been relentless in their exposing of government corruption. The charges are, among other things, defaming the president.
</p>
<p>Press freedom is an iffy matter here, as you can see.

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>We&#8217;ve been watching BBC at the hotel here this week. It&#8217;s far superior to CNN in any number of ways, but one of the most important is the news service&#8217;s distinctly worldwide reach, honed from decades of reporting the news around the globe without assuming, as CNN does, that the United States is the absolute center of virtually everything that matters.
</p>
<p>And in the BBC&#8217;s coverage, something has been coming through that should make the murderers of Sept. 11 very, very worried about their cause, not just their lives. The dead and missing in New York were from many nations, which stands to reason &#8212; New York has become a global mix of humanity, and the terrorists attacked the <i>World</i> Trade Center.
</p>
<p>More British citizens died there, I gather, than in any terrorist outrages in the U.K. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of non-U.S. citizens will be in the final toll, from nations around the world.
</p>
<p>Governments do not like having their nationals slaughtered. They get angry, and that&#8217;s one reason why there&#8217;s an unprecedented degree of unity among governments this week.
</p>
<p>Now we have to hope that the response, which will certainly be fierce, does not go too far. If we revenge ourselves by creating a host of new innocent victims, we will not win this conflict. We will only prolong it.
</p>
<p>A few brave commentators are asking uncomfortable questions this week, and being pilloried for their trouble. They are asking America to ask itself why we are so loathed in much of the world. President Bush&#8217;s statement that the terrorists hate freedom is probably true, but it&#8217;s incomplete.
</p>
<p>To ask those questions is <b>not</b> to assume some kind of bizarre moral eqivalency. The United States has many flaws, but on balance it&#8217;s a beacon of light on this troubled planet. The people who organized and supported Tuesday&#8217;s atrocity are beyond the pale. I have almost nothing in my heart for them.
</p>
<p>A friend noted the other day that when President Bush was contemplating what to do about federal funding of stem-cell research, he consulted ethicists and religious leaders, not just scientists and politicians. This week, for very good reasons, he&#8217;s been surrounded by the national security establishment. The president will do himself &#8212; and us all &#8212; a favor if he widens his field of thinking this time, too.
</p>
<p>Some of the most interesting coverage of this terrible event has been found through weblog links. Check out, among others, <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/news/special/attack/blog.html">SiliconValley.com</a> and Dave Winer&#8217;s <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Scripting News</a>.
</p>
<p>Note: I&#8217;ve noticed the the past several days that CNN has stopped its repeated showing of the Trade Center destruction. The incessant replaying of the plane exploding through the tower was, in almost the purest sense of the word, pornographic. I don&#8217;t know if the other networks are exercising restraint in the U.S. I hope they are.
</p>
<p>Note 2: Is America&#8217;s cargo-airline fleet any less a potential weapon? Fedex flies big jets, too. What&#8217;s being done to secure them?

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>There was a brief snippet on BBC the other day, in which Bill Clinton appeared at the armory in New York City where relatives of the missing people from the World Trade Center were looking for their loved ones, or at least word of whether they were lost. Clinton was at his absolute best. He comforted people, and clearly meant it. Asked what he&#8217;d do if he was president, he said forcefully, &#8220;I&#8217;m not the president,&#8221; and made clear that his mission was one of love and comfort, not policy.
</p>
<p>The U.S. government and the state and city of New York should put Bill Clinton to work &#8212; in a mission to help rebuild the city, the financial district and, most important, the lives of survivors. It would be an ideal role for a relatively young and obviously still-vigorous ex-president.
</p>
<p>Former presidents carve out roles for themselves. Jimmy Carter is the greatest in that sense. Clinton is still looking for a role in his new life.
</p>
<p>I can think of a hundred practical reasons why Clinton would reject this notion. And there&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that he and other former presidents will be doing their utmost in unofficial ways. But I can think of one reason to do it that may override the doubts. He &#8212; and the other ex-presidents &#8212; could be of enormous help in a time of real need.
</p>
<p>I called the United Airlines reservations line this morning, checking in to see how it looked for my rebooked flight back to the United States. The exhaustion in the voice of the woman at the other end was evident.
</p>
<p>So was her utter grief and anguish. Her company&#8217;s planes were used as weapons to help kill thousands of human beings. She has lost colleagues. The future of her company may be in doubt.
</p>
<p>I can be as impatient as anyone when it comes to customer service. Not now.
</p>
<p>Please remember: If you&#8217;re rebooking delayed travel or trying to start a new trip, that you&#8217;re talking with people who are hurting, deeply.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m at Johannesburg&#8217;s international airport, waiting for a flight to Frankfurt. The airline told me to check in early. Good advice &#8212; long, long lines and rigorous security.
</p>
<p>People in line are taking it with good grace. I wonder how long that will last. Air travelers are a demanding lot, especially the executive crowd that fills business class.
</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen anyone look truly happy in days, except some small children who are too young to understand why the rest of us are so grim. One very young boy ran through the terminal this afternoon. He was shrieking with evident joy. Maybe he was just delighted to be running on his little legs through this big new space. What kind of world will he inherit?

				<p>My former colleague <span class="email-removed" title="email address removed">Rory O&#8217;Connor</span> sent out the following:
</p>
<blockquote><p><i>This is not an original idea, but one a colleague suggested and seemed like a brilliant one to me.
<p> On Monday, when the stock markets reopen, every American should buy five or ten or twenty shares of their favorite stock. It doesn&#8217;t matter what, and it doesn&#8217;t have to involve spending a fortune. But if enough people did this, it could well serve to not only jump-start the markets, but boost consumer confidence and perhaps prevent the supposed psychological recession that some economists are sure will follow Tuesday&#8217;s tragedy.
<p> Remember: there is great uncertainty in the financial markets right now. With all the doom and gloom talk, the response by institutional investors, arbitragers, short sellers and others will be to cover their butts, run for the exits, put the markets into a tailspin &#8212; and play right into the hands of terrorists who hope their despicable act will create chaos and instability.
<p> We can show these terrorists they are wrong. Ordinary Americans doing this can have more impact than all the Federal Reserve statements in the world. Just 50 million Americans, one-fifth of the population, buying 20 shares each on Monday adds up to one billion shares on the &#8220;plus&#8221; side, firmly demonstrating faith in our institutions, the very ones that were attacked on Tuesday.
<p> Think of this in the same way you would buying a War Bond in World War II: volunteering a small amount of your money for a much larger, and hugely important cause. Millions of Americans did that in the face of global evil 60 years ago, and I&#8217;m sure Americans will answer the call facing the same situation today.
<p> Or you can think of it as a way to show support and solidarity with the people who lost so many colleagues in the collapse of the World Trade Center, a majority of whom work in the financial sector.
<p> Either way, this act would be a potent demonstration of America&#8217;s resolve never to be cowed by terrorists.
<p> Please feel free to pass this on to your IP list and to anyone else you wish. Help get the word out that there&#8217;s something every American can truly do in this time of national crisis and national unity.</p></blockquote>

				<p>The promotion of freedom and open societies have brought me and a large contingent of Americans to Zambia, a small, landlocked nation in Africa. We all feel helpless, numb, furious and every other emotion you can name.
</p>
<p>There was thought of canceling this part of a two-nation trip, which has been sponsored by the <a href="http://www.freedomforum.org">Freedom Forum</a>, a foundation that pushes the ideals of free speech and societies. But the reality was that none of us could have gone home if we wanted to. And to have canceled the Zambia stop, where we&#8217;re holding workshops and the forum is sponsoring a debate among presidential candidates, would have been to give the Sept. 11 murderers another, albeit small, victory.
</p>
<p>The people who sponsored these mass murder live in shadows. They loathe liberty, even though they claim they are promoting it for others.
</p>
<p>I will be talking today with African journalists from around the nation. Here, the freedom to report the truth is often in doubt. The journalists take risks simply by doing their jobs. They are heroes.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have more later.

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>In our fury, grief and horror, will we allow the criminals of Sept. 11 to wreck the American republic? They will have won if we do.
</p>
<p>They committed an act of war. There is no other way to look at these acts of barbarism.
</p>
<p>Now, as we hunt down their leaders and collaborators, and as we tend to the families of the dead and injured, we will be tempted beyond ourselves &#8212; tempted to abandon our rule of law and our Constitution.
</p>
<p>If we do that, the criminals will have won.
</p>
<p>These words feel hollow, somehow, in the wreckage of so many lives and America&#8217;s buoyancy.
</p>
<p>But in the next days and weeks we will find ourselves at a frontier. We will be asking ourselves whether we want &#8212; whether we can afford &#8212; to live in an open and free society. We will ask if the risks are worth the blood.
</p>
<p>If we are wise, we will wait to ask those questions. We will wait until hot rage has eased into an abiding, icy anger.
</p>
<p>We ordinary people should leave the hunting to the professionals, and focus on healing these staggering wounds.
</p>
<p>We have been tested before.
</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t yet born on December 7, 1941. But Tuesday may well have been a 21st Century Pearl Harbor &#8212; not just an outrage against our nation but a lesion to our souls and collective psyche.
</p>
<p>America responded with just wrath against the Japanese government and military. The nation entered a long war that ultimately saved the world from despotism.
</p>
<p>But America also responded with fear. We abandoned the Constitution when we imprisoned loyal citizens of Japanese heritage, only admitting the injustice so much later.
</p>
<p>Now we are going to be tested again. In the short term, some will want to take out their rage on neighbors whose only offense is to have an ethnic or religious background that is deemed suspicious.
</p>
<p>What happened on Tuesday was an act of war. The American government and military should and will respond in kind.
</p>
<p>If law enforcement and national security agencies declare war on the American people in the process, they will give the terrorists a gift. The despicable people who planned this will triumph if we add to the damage.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been watching TV reports from South Africa, in a land that has known much violence and injustice. Individual acts heroism in my tortured nation have been the rays of light on this dark, dark day.
</p>
<p>As America finds itself in coming days, the outward focus will be on bringing the September 11 criminals to the justice they deserve, and bringing peace to the victims and their families and friends. We will learn soon enough whether liberty is up to this test, as I pray it will be.
</p>
<p>In our homes and at work in coming days, amid our rage and sorrow and numbness, we can meet this trial by showing our best selves &#8212; with acts of cooperation, love and kindness.

				<p>Wired News: <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,46655,00.html">New Copyright Bill Heading to D.C.</a>. <i>With the help of Fritz Hollings (D-S.C.), the powerful chairman of the Senate Commerce committee, they hope to embed copy-protection controls in nearly all consumer electronic devices and PCs. All types of digital content, including music, video and e-books, are covered.</i>
</p>
<p>We&#8217;re seeing again and again who the real pirates are these days. They are the barons of the entertainment industry, and they will not be satisfied until they win absolute control over everything that moves.
</p>
<p>This law would make the Digital Millennium Copyright Act look mild. It is the ultimate attack on your rights. It would destroy your privacy, or what&#8217;s left of privacy.
</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t advocate breaking the law. But if this passes, and is not declared unconstitutional, there will be civil disobedience on a scale not seen in decades.
