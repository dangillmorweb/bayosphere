<p>So much for free speech, I guess.  Not like we didn&#8217;t know it was dead long ago.  The disclaimer below says it all I guess.  Still, even with the New World Order of journalism, I thought we were allowed to keep our senses of humor, irony, and as Cornel West puts it (to paraphrase), &#8220;the ability to revel in the absurdity that IS life in this country, today.&#8221;  Sadly, I guess all of those human traits go down with the free speech ship.  Wow.  Maybe that&#8217;s why the founders counted it so fundamental, because without free speech, our humanity is choked off.  One censored word at a time.</p>
<p>I guess my censored post falls in the &#8220;otherwise objectional to us in any way&#8221; bucket, seeing as it didn&#8217;t fit in any of the others.  Just out of curiosity, it would be interesting to see a brief post describing the nature of the offense committed by the censored post so that myself and other readers can avoid that sin in the future.  In any game, it&#8217;s hard to stay inbounds if the boundaries keep closing in during the game.</p>
<p>No need to freak out and go on an IP address hunt, I&#8217;ve spent years around Internet security, so all you have to do is ask and I&#8217;ll gladly provide phone contact information.</p>

<p>[crunch, crunch, chomp, crunch, blech!] Sound of humanoid eating crow for screwing up the posting in the first place.  He did hit STOP immediately upon realizing his mistake, and a reload of the page convinced him of success, but it must not have been soon enough.  /me thinks confession may be good for the soul but it&#8217;s a nuke for unjustifiable pride.</p>
<p>[clank, swish, plink, clunk] Sound of humanoid cleaning up dishes after eating an entire humble pie for desert.</p>
<p>[sigh] Sound of humanoid thinking that he&#8217;ll use the Opera Browser note function in the future as a way to protect himself from himself.</p>
<p>[pray, pray, pray]  Sound of silent plea that Dan, purely out of unmerited favor, delete this entire thread of evidence of humanoid&#8217;s embarrassing knee-jerk response without asking first, as any reasonable humanoid would have done.  </p>
<p>[mutter, mumble, mope] Sound of humanoid justifying himself under his breath for the knee-jerk, due to having just settled a three month debate with soulless Washington Mutual automatons just hours prior to encountering the eJournal 404 Not Found.  {whiny violins mode} Consequently, humanoid is compelled to confess the sin that he was having some issues with being unheard and misunderstood that particluar day.  Even though WAMU (wham-you) conceded that the bank was in error for trashing his credit RIAA style, it still cost humanoid hours of needless distraction which will continue as he now goes through the credit rating exhoneration process.  Humanoid appreciates that the eJournal feels his pain, because, in the words of the infamous Harry Tuttle, &#8220;we&#8217;re all in this together.&#8221; {/whiny violins mode}</p>
<p>[whirr&#8230;clack] Sound of humanoid opening the DVD drive to insert Terry Gilliam&#8217;s 1986 &#8220;Brazil&#8221; movie for peer-intervention-ordered recovery therapy.</p>
<p>[snore, wheeze, snore] Sound of humanoid falling asleep and dreaming of his mother, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t have anything nice to say, don&#8217;t say anything at all.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2003_09_01_archive.html#106398624717426998">Cory</a> points to an unintentionally hilarious page of instructions from Sun Microsystems, in which it explains how all humanity <a href="http://www.sun.com/policies/trademarks/code.cgi?sg=combo&#038;code1=examples/ex3.html">may use Sun&#8217;s trademarks</a>.</p>
<p>All I can say is that I don&#8217;t know much about the Sun Fire&#8217;s features, and won&#8217;t be buying any Sun Rays. Java-tizing my Web page is too time-consuming, and the Sun isn&#8217;t shining on such ridiculous rules.

<p>This sounds like overreaching stupidity, but couldn&#8217;t<br />it just be tunnel-visioned legal stupidity? The context<br />from the Sun terms of use document says &#8220;Sun trademarks<br />must not be used as a noun&#8221; &#8212; aren&#8217;t they just saying<br />they don&#8217;t want the &#8220;Kleenex&#8221; or &#8220;Xerox&#8221; problem?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that it&#8217;s valid, I&#8217;m just saying that maybe<br />it&#8217;s boilerplate legalese &#8212; not a creative new form of<br />stupidity.</p>

<p>I believe trademarks are always supposed to be used as adjectives.  So the Sun trademark guidelines are just expressing the proper way to use trademarks. </p>
<p>I worked at Apple for many years, and (no surprise) Apple is very big on proper trademark and logo usage.  In fact, Apple has its own page of trademark guidelines:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html">http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html</a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s also an up to date list of Apple&#8217;s trademarks online, which makes for an interesting trip down memory lane:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/appletmlist.html">http://www.apple.com/legal/appletmlist.html</a></p>

<p>Compare that to the Knight-Ridder trademark notice at <a href="http://www.knightridder.com/notices.html">http://www.knightridder.com/notices.html</a> which says you can&#8217;t use them in any way at all.</p>
<p>Ooops, I just used a Knight-Ridder trademark without permission! Oh no, I did it again!</p>

<li>Mercury News: <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/business/6791435.htm">Senate rejects new media ownership rules</a>. <i>The U.S. Senate sent a stinging rebuke to the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday, voting to overturn the agency&#8217;s new rules that would allow media giants to buy more newspapers, TV and radio stations.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This is only one step, but a vital one, in restoring some sense of balance in a debate that has been decided by a small group of insiders in the media and political businesses. The public does not want a few ventriloquists saying most of what we hear, and at long last the people in political power are listening.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re listening in the halls of Congress because they, too, are beginning to understand the danger of too much concentration. The Disney people aren&#8217;t ideological; all they want is money and growth.</p>
<p>The irony in the current situation is that the rule changes recently enacted by the FCC aren&#8217;t all that big a shift. But they were a straw on a camel&#8217;s back, possibly the one that broke it.

<p>I don&#8217;t know if <a href="http://www.photo.net/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=005zOm">this report</a> on Photo.net is for real, but it has the definite ring of reality. (I hope the local newspaper will check it out.) Here&#8217;s how the tale starts:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;I&#8217;m writing this to alert all of you to be very aware WHERE you are shooting while in the United States! Yesterday I was out doing some street shooting and apparently I wandered a little too close to our Federal Building downtown with my camera and I was immediately ran down by four officers, detained and questioned for over an hour.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Think about this. Are the authorities really this paranoid?</p>
<p>Does it seem logical that actual terrorists would take pictures this way? Wouldn&#8217;t they use the mini-cameras that can be disguised or hidden?</p>
<p>The paranoia is understandable, if over the top. But it&#8217;s also a sign that America is wasting time and resources on internal defense if the police go so berserk in such an innocent situation.

<p>>Are the authorities really this paranoid?</p>
<p>Yes, at least in NYC they are, but you know what? If they&#8217;d been that paranoid before 9/11 might not have happened. All last year I worked downtown on Broad Street and right outside our front door was where they stopped all the vehicles headed towards the stock exchange so bomb sniffing dogs could inspect them. There were cops dressed like soldiers carrying automatic weapons right outside the exchange. We were all glad they were all there. It made it easier working next to a target.</p>
<p>Where do you draw the line? One of the things I learned working as a bartender in this town is that most people don&#8217;t recognize violence happening in front of them until it&#8217;s too late to keep it from happening. Americans just don&#8217;t recognize it for what it is let alone know how to prevent it. We&#8217;ve always depended on other people to do it for us. I think we are now experiencing the price of freedom as some people in other countries do. </p>
<p>>cameras?</p>
<p>Nothing fancy, they use regular cameras and look like tourists from all I&#8217;ve read. Easier to not be noticed.</p>

<p>Sorry, Jim, but Dan&#8217;s right. There is no way any security issues are going to be hanging out on the street for any passerby with any camera and any motive to photograph. And if there is, then shame on the morons who put the &#8220;secret stuff&#8221; in plain view.</p>
<p>This kind of paranoiac over-reaction reeks of a police state, which of course means it fits right into the right-wing religio-political agenda of the Bush Regime.</p>

<p>Not to make light of this, but ok, sorry, &#8230;.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a Fed, and see someone taking pictures of your building using a common camera, then you need to fill the nearest van full of bullets.  Someone is trying to measure your response.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a Fed, and see someone taking pictures of your building using a common camera, then sit back and relax, do nothing to reveal your true preparedness, but start up a cointel op.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a Fed, and see someone taking pics of your building using a common camera, then harass the individual mercilessly, thus disseminating the false information that our culture may soon face a collapse of our civil liberties, thus enabling the fly paper theory and bringing our enemies out of the woodwork so as to pile on us and bring us down.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a Fed, and see someone taking pics of your building using a common camera, then harass the folks mercilessly, because you have to justify your budget and because absolute power corrupts.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not a Fed and observing the Busco and the Justice department, use Occam&#8217;s Razor.</p>

<p>I am an amature photographer and I like to take pictures of old buildings. If the police came up to me while taking pictures of a federal building and asked to see my ID and were courteous I wouldn&#8217;t have a problem. I sure wouldn&#8217;t make them have to run me down&#8230; Unless of course I was doing something wrong at the time. <br />&#8212; Quote &#8211; I&#8217;m writing this to alert all of you to be very aware WHERE you are shooting while in the United States! Yesterday I was out doing some street shooting and apparently I wandered a little too close to our Federal Building downtown with my camera and I was immediately ran down by four officers, detained and questioned for over an hour. end quote.</p>
<p> I think perhaps we haven&#8217;t heard the whole story. I don&#8217;t believe the police are going to act like storm troopers unless provoked. Like by running when confronted or refusing to co-operate by showing ID. I hope we aren&#8217;t making this molehill into a mountain.</p>

<p>This is probably true.  I tried to take a picture of the local US 5th Circuit Courthouse one Sunday, with the idea that our law firm&#8217;s website needed a picture of a local court.  I was immediately approached by a security officer who asked that I not do that.  I asked him since when did it become illegal to take a picture of a public building from a public location?  He was uncomfortable and I made it clear that I was a lawyer and I truly wanted to know what his opinion was.  He of course had to keep his &#8216;game face&#8217; on and so I relieved his anxiety by telling him that I would accede to his request to make things easier; but I also informed him that he was really on shaky legal ground.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I had another window into the soul of federal security when I ran into the Head Marshall of the local federal district court at a fundraiser.  I told him I was pleased to hear the announcement that the local court was finally going to allow cellphones in the court; he said that I was misinformed.  I told him that the Chief Judge of the Court had made the annoucement at a public meeting.  He said that was a silly thing to do and that she didn&#8217;t understand the security risk.  I asked what security risk a cellphone would pose.  He said &#8220;plastic explosives.&#8221;  In the phone, I asked?  Yes, he replied.  What about the PDAs that are allowed in?  He said those shouldn&#8217;t be allowed either.   </p>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised that they let us wear clothes.  If it were up to him we&#8217;d all change into Orange jumpsuits.  Ah, the mind of the diligent security-conscious government official.  It&#8217;s really a sad thing to behold.</p>

<p>A co-worker was taking pictures on his lunch hour in downtown Chicago year or so ago, not real long after 9/2001 and had a cop threaten to confiscate his (new, expensive, digital) camera.  If I remember correctly (which I may or may not) he had to delete the image in their presence for them to let him go.</p>
<p>I thought it was depressing then.  It&#8217;s more depressing to think it&#8217;s still going on.</p>
<p>It is heartening to see that more and more Americans are willing to protest the conversion of our once free nation into a police state, though.</p>

<p>Dan:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen posts like this before on photo.net, and I don&#8217;t know if the most recent one is genuine or a hoax, but it is alarming if true.</p>
<p>As a fine art photographer and occasional event photographer, I&#8217;m troubled by the severe restrictions placed on photography by many government and commercial entities. It&#8217;s a crime to raise a tripod virtually anywhere in Las Vegas &#8211; even on the street. I&#8217;ve been chased away from Park Service parking lots because of security concerns. (I live a few miles from Yosemite.)</p>
<p>The proliferation of camera phones and the increasing portability and ubiquity of digital cameras and storage are going to meet this kind of heavy-handed enforcement head-on. You can&#8217;t stop people from making snapshots when and where they want, despite posted notices or personal endangerment &#8211; witness the folks pulled over in the &#8220;no stopping &#8211; rockfall danger&#8221; areas around Yosemite!</p>

<p>I walked around Washington, DC a few weeks ago as a tourist, taking photos of all kinds of federal buildings, the Capitol, etc. and no one said anything.  It is a tradition there to take photos of our nation&#8217;s landmarks.  Why should it be different anywhere else?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read that you can even take photos on the DC Metro, which I did, as long as you don&#8217;t use a tripod.  But for some reason you can&#8217;t take photos on the New York subways without a permit.  Seems inconsistent to me.

<p>I&#8217;m an amateur photographer, I&#8217;d thought about wandering around our county taking pictures of the &#8220;Art in Public Places&#8221; that are part of any buildinjg built with govt funds.   Decided not to as stories similar to this one have been in the news since right after 9/11/01 &#8211; one guy in NY got interrogated because the statue in public he was photographing faced a govt. building.</p>
<p>and don&#8217;t forget the guy who was interrogated in DC for videotaping the monuments &#8211; a very abnormal thing for a tourist to do.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t say what alledgedly happened was right, it was certainly an amateurish encounter as described.</p>
<p>What I said was:<br />1. Yes authorities are paranoid<br />2. Not only did we get used to working in a secure area but came to appreciate it<br />3. Americans usually don&#8217;t notice danger in real life because they are unaccustomed to it<br />4. I&#8217;ve seen statements related to terroist recon that said the people involved appeared as a tourists taking pictures and if you stop and think about it clandestine efforts would be more obvious than touristy type activities<br />5. I asked where we draw the line</p>
<p>I do not agree with unprofessional police behavior nor am I impressed by &#8220;my rights&#8221; rants. There is a realistic middle ground that has yet to be recognized. We will lose some &#8220;rights&#8221; and nothing will change that. When I was a bartender we could spot non-New Yorkers because they just weren&#8217;t aware of the space around them. New Yorkers cover their space instinctivly to avoid unpleasant situations. Most Americans, unlike Israelis, South Aficans, or many other populations an ocean away, have only seen violence as entertainment and when it, or the preperation for it, is happening in front of their faces have no idea what they are seeing. The natural consequence of this lack of education and experience is repressive amateurish policy and procedure with &#8220;victim&#8221; backlash.</p>
<p>It is going to take some time to flesh out realistic policies and procedures to deal with activities that may or may not be security risks. Until that has happened we will all be subject to abuses from the lowest paid, least educated minions of law enforcement (the guys who carry guns and make decisions in the street).</p>
<p>Until then then, my experience with the police has taught me it doesn&#8217;t matter what the law is at any given moment, the legality isn&#8217;t judged until the next day or later in a dispassionate objective way. If one of these guys stops you, be polite and cooperative. You can make a case the following day.</p>
<p>Of course, if you want to be pro-active, don&#8217;t do anything to draw attention to yourself to begin with. If you want to be part of the solution start pushing for clarification of security procedures and be willing to pay more taxes for the neccessary educationa of police and the public.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like it but I do believe that no matter what we say or do our world has changed and freedom as we have experienced it will be no more than a memory. Anything less than that is unrealistic.</p>

<p>You must not be a railfan, Dan.</p>
<p>There are people whose hobby is photographing locomotives, cars, track, buildings, structures, equipment, scenery, and pretty much everything around railroads.  There have been railfans nearly as long as there have been railroads and cameras, and model railroaders who want their layouts to be historically accurate are very grateful to them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read several reports in the hobby press of photographers being stopped by railroad security officers and local police.  Since a lot of law enforcement officers have never heard of railfanning, sometimes they&#8217;re detained for quite a while.  Some folks suggest carrying a railfan guide to the area with you.</p>
<p>While going onto railroad property or right of way has always been trespassing, in the past, so long as you looked like you weren&#8217;t likely to steal anything or hurt yourself, railroad security people would look the other way or even help you find a good vantage point for a shot.  Nowadays, according to the hobby press, they tend to run you off or detain you.</p>
<p>When I was staying near Heathrow several years ago, I&#8217;d notice pretty good sized groups of aviation fans taking pictures, and I imagine it&#8217;s even harder on them.</p>

<p>Dan, you disappoint me.  Not in your concern about the knee-jerk security reactions (although I tend to agree with Jim Moran&#8217;s well-reasoned words).  </p>
<p>What bothers me is the fact that you, a reasonably respected 🙂 journalist, have reported what you admit is not a substantiated report as if that was irrelevant.  Instead, you dismiss that as some other entities responsibility for verifying.  </p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that the kind of b.s. that the Bush administration pulls, quoting dubious sources to support their prejudices?  C&#8217;mon, Dan&#8230;give us a standard to live up to&#8230;otherwise blognews becomes as useless in advancing the pursuit of truth as the nitwit callers on talk radio.</p>

<p>So, if the Appeals Court ruling <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/6779192.htm">delaying the California recall</a> holds up, it&#8217;ll likely ensure the installation of more modern voting machines throughout California. So far, so good.</p>
<p>But if the result is the use of touch-screen machines that have no verifiable audit trail &#8212; a paper printout of the ballot so the voter can verify his or her choices &#8212; then we&#8217;ll have created a monster. Unfortunately, local and state voting officials have been almost totally tone-deaf to the danger, and many of the machines already installed are demonstrably open to doubt. (See the <a href="http://www.verifiedvoting.org/">Verified Voting</a> website, operated by Stanford University&#8217;s David Dill, a computer scientist who has blown the whistle &#8212; and is finally being heard to some degree &#8211; on this scandal.)</p>
<p>Nothing is more important to our trust in democracy than a verifiable ballot. Yet we&#8217;re rushing headlong toward a system where we can&#8217;t be sure that our votes are being counted at all. This is nuts.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s use the delay, assuming it happens, to make these electronic machines believable. There&#8217;s a lot at stake.

<p>I don&#8217;t see how this decision will have any effect on new voting machines for California, since there&#8217;s already a consent decree in place that mandates the end of punch-card balloting by March, 2004. This decision simply seeks to frustrate democracy by delaying the election from its Constitutional timetable.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not feeling much frustration at the decision, Richard, at least not compared to what I felt as I watched a rich politician buy a recall election.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty nervous about the use of touch-screen machines.  Not only is the absence of a paper trail a serious problem, but I suspect that the poll workers are going to have a difficult time dealing with voter questions and machine problems.  Dan, how about putting out a call to techies to serve as poll workers in the upcoming election?</p>

<p>Regarding Dan&#8217;s comment:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing is more important to our trust in democracy than a verifiable ballot.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to put on equal footing the need to have a vigorous and informed electorate.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d wager that a majority of people walking around in a typical Wallmart:</p>
<p>a) Don&#8217;t vote</p>
<p>b) Don&#8217;t have a clue who John Ashcroft is.</p>
<p>Our blessed democracy is drowning in a sea of indifference and apathy.</p>
<p>And as much as I agree with the absolute necessity of maintaining a paper record of our votes&#8230;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but think&#8230;that even with the paper trail&#8230;we are still slouching towards despotism.</p>

<p>If they install machines with no paper trail in my county, I&#8217;ll permanently switch to absentee ballot.  I think that will be paper for a while longer (but maybe not forever).</p>

<p>Two upsides to this election that won&#8217;t happen:</p>
<p>1)  Regardless of how dumb I think the recall is, I had some hope that by managing to have an important election in just six weeks, we (the US) would have a movement to shorten all elections.  Do we really need 18 months of nobody paying attention and bazillions of dollars spent?  Would it be more democratic and possible to hold presidential campaigns say, two months after the primary?  Would our short attention span America pay more attention to such an election? </p>
<p>2)  Chaddy ballots bad.  Theftible e-voting horrid.  How about an experiment in old time ballot counting?  Count the ballots by hand in each precinct, monitored by anyone that wants to monitor them.  Use lotto technology to pull out statistical sample size and count those.  Send both results in by fax signed by monitors.  Bundle ballots in lock box for collection.  Even with 45million ballots served, I am not sure we need anything more than paper ballots.</p>

<p>It was mainly the Wal-Mart and Costco shoppers who signed the petitions for the recall, Bob, and nobody had to pay them a dime to sign. Eventually, they&#8217;ll have their votes counted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dan, how about putting out a call to techies to serve as poll workers in the upcoming election?&#8221;</p>
<p>Such a good idea it had to be repeated.</p>
<p>Stay with this story Dan, you will never cover a more important one.</p>

<p>Positives:</p>
<p>1. For Davis, changes the outcome of the election (same time as democratic primary and helps Davis prove he should remain Governor).</p>
<p>2. For Democrats, gives the Republicans more time to implode (Pro Life Republicans vs. every other type of Republicans, especially Arnold).</p>
<p>3. May help the non-Arnold candidate (recently gaining traction).</p>
<p>4. Positives will be theoretically a more accurate vote.  With the percentage possible of inaccuracy with the chad being irrevelant.</p>
<p>Negatives:</p>
<p>1. We may end up in lame duck time for a while longer that does not help CA.</p>
<p>2. Process isssues of people who already absentee ballotted.</p>

<p>No one paid the petition signers, Richard.  But someone did pay to organize the signature collection.  And I&#8217;m betting you knew that.</p>
<p>For those of us who bothered to go to the polls during the last election, our votes have already been counted.  Didn&#8217;t even have to go to Wal-Mart.</p>

<p>There is a lot about this subject that is not being brought to light these days. Thank you to Dan for writing about this. </p>
<p>There is a website  about the book, &#8220;Black Box Voting&#8221;. The website contains current info. on the status of systems that are not reliable/provide no paper trail and state secretaries who either don&#8217;t care or who are in collusion with the profit makers. </p>
<p>My question about the CA recall and the vote timing is: are the counties (esp. Santa Clara county) ordering new equipment locked in<br />
to their orders? Are they ordering touch-screen voting machines with no paper trail? Is there no time left to change the mind of the buyers?</p>
<p>Our right to vote is one of our most fundamental rights. It is in danger of being undermined in a very quiet way, whether people realize or care that it&#8217;s happening or not. It&#8217;s time to educate ourselves and those around us.</p>

<p>But someone did pay to organize the signature collection.</p>
<p>Just as someone paid to organize the signature gathering for every other initiative, including medical marijuana, de-criminalization of first offense drug convictions, the mandatory floor on school spending, and the ban on the eating of horse meat. That&#8217;s how the system works, and it takes about three cents per Californian to get a popular initiative qualified. There were attempts to recall every other governor since Jerry Brown, and they all faild. Is this the corrupting power of money in politics, or a rational reaction to an extremely corrupt and unpopular governor?</p>
<p>The voters will decide that, if and when the Ninth Circuit decides to let democracy go forward.</p>

<li>AP: <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/wire/2003/09/14/patriot/">New terror laws used vs. common criminals</a>. <i>In the two years since law enforcement agencies gained fresh powers to help them track down and punish terrorists, police and prosecutors have increasingly turned the force of the new laws not on al-Qaida cells but on people charged with common crimes.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This is a surprise only to people who believe George Bush and his &#8216;Justice&#8217; Department didn&#8217;t know exactly what they were doing from the start. They used Sept. 11 to get everything else on their agenda.</p>
<p>Suddenly, people are realizing that crime of the old style has been redefined as terrorism. This is a an abuse of law and order. For this crowd, it&#8217;s business as usual.

<p>This shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise to anyone:  they&#8217;ve been doing<br />this sort of thing with the asset forfeiture laws for years.</p>
<p>More recently,  we&#8217;ve had people who merely pulicize <br />embarrasssing computer vulnerabilities prosecuted under<br />the laws intended to punish people who make use of them<br />to do harm.</p>
<p>Those who doubt that this is part of &#8220;an agenda&#8221; should note<br />that Ashcroft showed up on Capitol Hill with a shredded in<br />one hand,  and a ready-to-enact copy of &#8220;Bill of Rights 2.0&#8221;<br />in the other,  before the fires at the WTC were put out.</p>
