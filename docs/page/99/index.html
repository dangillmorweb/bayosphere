				<span class="meta-prep meta-prep-author">Posted on</span> <a href="http://bayosphere.com/2000/08/10/napster-meets-instant-messaging/" title="12:00 pm" rel="bookmark"><span class="entry-date">August 10, 2000</span></a> <span class="meta-sep">by</span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="http://bayosphere.com/author/dan-gillmor/" title="View all posts by Dan Gillmor">Dan Gillmor</a></span>			</div><!-- .entry-meta -->

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>   Take the most popular instant-messaging program and an Internet file-sharing system that defies censorship or control. Put them into a software stew. The result is <a href="http://www.aimster.com">Aimster</a>.</p>
<p>   Aimster piggybacks on two technologies that connect individual Internet users. One is America Online&#8217;s <a href="http://www.aol.com/aim/home.html">AOL Instant Messenger</a>, or AIM for short, the messaging software now used by tens of millions of people.</p>
<p>   Aimster&#8217;s real purpose is to let people share data. For this it uses the <a href="http://gnutella.wego.com">Gnutella</a> file-sharing system.</p>
<p>   By being a file-sharing program, Gnutella resembles the hugely popular Napster, which has been under legal attack from the music industry. Under the hood the two are different. Unlike Napster, Gnutella doesn&#8217;t require centralized computers to work. It can also be used to share all kinds of files, not just music.</p>
<p>   But Gnutella, an &#8221;open source&#8221; package that&#8217;s freely available for download and modification, is difficult to set up and operate. Aimster tries to solve this problem with a more user-friendly interface that users can modify with different &#8221;skins&#8221; suited to one&#8217;s own taste.</p>
<p>   Aimster&#8217;s creators believe they have a clever solution to one of Napster&#8217;s bigger problems, namely the legal one. When Aimster users share files, they can only share with people on their AIM &#8221;buddy lists&#8221; &#8212; people who tend to be colleagues, family or friends.</p>
<p>   John Deep, an Aimster co-founder, said from the company&#8217;s office in Troy, N.Y., that this several benefits for users. First, they&#8217;re in a safer environment by definition, with people they&#8217;ve allowed to be buddies. Second, he said, the law permits friends to share music for personal use.</p>
<p>   I&#8217;m no lawyer, but I suspect that the paranoid recording industry will sic its well-paid legal sharks on Aimster. I also suspect they&#8217;ll lose this time, but the law has been tilted strongly toward copyright holders lately.</p>
<p>   Then there&#8217;s the ever-voracious AOL, which just hates it when people do anything with AIM that AOL hasn&#8217;t authorized. Aimster uses the AIM software itself as part of the package. So as far as AOL can tell, the Aimster user is simply using AIM, Deep said.</p>
<p>   Here&#8217;s my instant message about Aimster, and you&#8217;re free to share it: This looks pretty clever.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Regulators Do Right by Investors</font> </p>
<p>AP: <a href="http://www.sjmercury.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/033161.htm">SEC adopts rule barring companies&#8217; advance notice to analysts</a>. <i>Critics of selective disclosure, including SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, say it unfairly gives a privileged few access to company information &#8212; and the opportunity to trade on it &#8212; that is denied to others.</i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>This rule is one of the best thing the Securities and Exchange Commission has done in years. Selective disclosure has been a scandal.</p>
<p>You have to be amused by the bleatings of Wall Street and corporate insiders who think it&#8217;s fine to leak information to a favored few. They say information will now flow less efficiently as a result of the new rules.</p>
<p>Bull. Technology gives companies an easy way to get information to the world quickly. Why, for example, don&#8217;t companies offer e-mail bulletins to shareholders and other interested parties? If they&#8217;re making an announcement, they can send the email to everyone at the same time. This isn&#8217;t rocket science.</p>
<p>Wall Street has thrived for years on creating markets and, simultaneously, choke points. The SEC&#8217;s new rule will be good for everyone but the analysts and insiders who made money on deliberate inefficiency.</p>

				<p>We were stuck on the ground in Denver yesterday for a bit under two hours past our scheduled departure for San Francisco. The explanation from the captain of our United flight was that SFO was permitting only limited runway operations, hence we&#8217;d all have to wait our turn. Yet a United plane that was scheduled to leave Denver for San Francisco an hour and 15 minutes after our original departure time arrived in San Francisco soon after we did. It made me wonder if we&#8217;d been given false information.</p>
<p>At this point, I tend to believe what the airline told us. But United should look in the mirror when it looks for someone to blame for the fact that customers tend to be suspicious. The airline has been torturing its customers this year, with yet another <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/breaking/headline2/039762.htm">spate of canceled flights</a> (AP) announced today.</p>
<p>If switching airlines would make a huge difference, I would. I&#8217;m assuming United will eventually return to being no worse than the rest, which is no compliment to any of them. About the only airline I enjoy is Southwest, for short flights.</p>
<p>The airline industry&#8217;s indifference to customer service isn&#8217;t unique.</p>
<p>While in the Denver area over the weekend, my Verizon (formerly GTE) mobile phone service didn&#8217;t work properly. I spent about two hours on the phone with the company, to no avail. It turned out there was a network problem, according to a call I received yesterday from the company, which hadn&#8217;t bothered to tell its customer-service people during the weekend.</p>
<p>I did learn from one of those folks that there is a problem with the Qualcomm phone I use (model number 860). Verizon knows that these phones have problems delivering alerts that messages have been received. Were they going to tell their customers? Not unless or until customers called to complain, apparently.</p>
<p>Verizon&#8217;s voice mail system is an utter joke. A message was left for me while I was in Colorado. The company admits it can&#8217;t alert customers to messages received when they&#8217;re outside their home area (no one tells you this when you sign up; you have to find it for yourself in the fine print). But it wasn&#8217;t until many hours after I got back to California on Monday that the system let me know there was a message waiting. Pathetic.</p>
<p>I asked the customer-service people whether I could cancel due to the problems. The answer was no. I could put the service on suspension for the remainder of my year-long contract, paying $10 a month, if I chose. Of course, then I&#8217;d be subjecting myself to the other wireless providers. Judging from the complaints I hear about them, Verizon is probably no worse than the rest.</p>
<p>What United and Verizon have in common is this: They are in businesses where oligolopies rule &#8212; small numbers of very large companies. Yes, customers can shop elsewhere, but all of the major players in these industries behave the same way &#8212; with indifference to their customers. In a boom economy, they have us pretty much by the throat.</p>
<p>Normally, when the business cycle brings another recession, these companies would regret the way they&#8217;ve treated people. I wonder. Oligopolies may not have to care. With so few major competitors in the airline and wireless communications businesses, it&#8217;s difficult to see why customer service will ever be more than an afterthought.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of deregulation. But I fear we&#8217;re moving into the worst of both worlds.</p>

<p><font size=4>ZDNet Problem is on My End</font> </p>
<p>Never mind on my recent query about <a href="http://www.zdnet.com">ZDNet</a>, which I&#8217;ve been having trouble accessing. Turns out the problem is with my office network configuration (still unclear precisely what&#8217;s wrong). Works fine from my ISP at home. </p>

				<p>I can be a mighty dim bulb at times. But I finally understood what makes Napster so important, beyond the music: its architecture.</p>
<p>More in my <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg080600.htm">Sunday column</a>.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>UPDATES:</p>
<p>
<li>Robert Black points me to <a href="http://www.dialupdns.com/">DialupDNS.com</a>. Interesting&#8230;</p>
<p>
<li>Jacob Levy writes to say that UserLand Software is getting closest to the vision. I wondered if <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio UserLand</a> might be the beginnings of the new platform. Dave Winer replied:</p>
<p><i>It&#8217;s a simple to use writing tool and music organizer/player, with an HTTPserver and programming system and database hidden behind a hood-lift.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also an Internet-based  &#8220;cloud&#8221; that connects the users together. Itis openly documented, so it can be implemented in any scripting environmentwhich knows about HTTP and XML, which is all of them, today.</p>
<p>At a user level, you are part of a community that explores music and writesabout it. People are connected based on common interests from a musical pov.</p>
<p>Napster is an application, so is Radio UserLand, but RU goes one stepfurther, because it is a platform, and where Napster uses a custom protocol,we embrace the existing standards of HTTP and XML.</p>
<p>We also are building-in support for Napster&#8217;s protocols now. Leaving nostone unturned! ;-></i></p></blockquote>

				<p>As predictable as it is discouraging, the online stock trading marketplace lures the gamblers among us, as the <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/441644.asp">Wall Street Journal</a> reports today.<br />

<p>   We&#8217;re also a little closer to the semi-popular election of members of the organization&#8217;s board of directors. An ICANN nominating committee made public a slate of nominees this week, and one is Stanford&#8217;s newest celebrity law professor, ex-Harvard Prof. <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/lessig.html">Lawrence Lessig</a>. Lessig is widely respected in the cyber-community.</p>
<p>   ICANN, which administers the domain-name system that lets computers on the Net find each other, said it&#8217;ll be taking applications for the new domains from Sept. 5 through Oct. 2. The public will have exactly two weeks to comment &#8212; that seems awfully quick to me &#8212; before the staff formally begins pondering which domains to allow. No one knows how many ICANN will approve, but it could be anywhere from one to 10 or so. (Two or three now seems like the most probable number, based on debate and comment at ICANN&#8217;s board meeting last month in Japan.)</p>
<p>   The $50,000 application fee still strikes me as excessive. Given that winning the right to adminster one of these new domains is likely to be extremely profitable, it seems more fair to charge the winners a much larger fee. Of course, that might lead to an excessive number of applications, too many for ICANN&#8217;s staff to handle.</p>
<p>   Five at-large directors will be elected later this year by the new at-large ICANN membership, people worldwide who managed to sign up on the organization&#8217;s grossly underperforming computers. I was able to sign up, but only after multiple attempts over many days.</p>
<p>   ICANN claims it was surprised by the number of people who registered, but the computers severely restricted the numbers. It all raises serious questions about the entire process. (I&#8217;ll be following up on those questions in coming weeks.)</p>
<p>   The public members will be able to nominate candidates for the board seats. I&#8217;ll be watching closely to see who else from North America &#8212; voters can only cast ballots for people from their own regions of the globe &#8212; surfaces as a possible candidate.</p>
<p>   At the moment, it&#8217;s hard for me to imagine that anyone better than Lessig will turn up. I&#8217;ve been critical of ICANN&#8217;s ways of doing business, but Lessig&#8217;s nomination is a positive sign.</p>

<p><font size=4>John Gilmore on Napster, DeCSS and Copyright</font> </p>
<p>My recent <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg072800.htm">Music Industry Can&#8217;t Win</a> column about the Napster battle prompted an e-mail exchange with the <a href="http://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.toad.com/gnu/">John Gilmore</a> during the past few days. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve posted a slightly edited version of John&#8217;s <a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/stories/storyReader$458">most recent note</a>, which I found especially thought-provoking.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Saving Money, but at What Cost?</font> </p>
<p>An insurance company that goes by the name of &#8220;Progressive&#8221; is offering lower rates to people who drive less during off-peak hours and in safer areas. How does the company know customers are doing this? By <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/440897.asp">putting a spy device inside the car</a> (MSNBC).</p>
<p>Fittingly, this is available only in Texas at the moment. But it&#8217;s an abomination. You have to wonder whether the people who are opting to save a few bucks realize what they&#8217;re buying &#8212; a device that could be used to track their every movement. </p>
<p>Many people who do this will shrug, figuring they have nothing to hide. I wonder how they&#8217;ll feel when their driving records are subpoenaed by divorce lawyers, employers, insurance companies, police and anyone else who wants a look.</p>
<p>I am increasingly frightened by the willingness of people to surrender their fundamental liberties, won at enormous cost by brave people over the decades and centuries, for such short-term gains. This country is heading toward becoming a surveillance society, and not enough people understand the consequences.</p>
<p>If you believe that privacy is meaningless, go ahead and buy insurance from &#8220;Progressive&#8221; when it&#8217;s offered in your state. But if you believe privacy and personal liberty don&#8217;t matter, consider the consequences. </p>
<p>A nation that values neither privacy nor liberty is ultimately a nation that stifles personal initiative. Don&#8217;t imagine for a minute that a free market can exist in an unfree society.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Anti-Spammers: Too Much Power</font> </p>
<p>I consider spammers slightly below cockroaches on the evolutionary scale. But there&#8217;s something just a little too arbitrary about the way the the <a href="http://mail-abuse.org/">Mail Abuse Prevention Service</a>, or MAPS, operates. Entire domains find their e-mail cut off from much of the Internet if MAPS decides spammers are using those domains.</p>
<p>Now the Harris polling operation has <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/ap/docs/264973l.htm">sued MAPS subscribers</a> (AP), including America Online and several large Internet service providers, for blocking access to millions of e-mail customers.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know the details of this suit. But it&#8217;s clear enough that MAPS has a lot of power that goes largely unscrutinized. </p>

				<p>The dot-com media have descended on Philadelphia in big ways, according to various news outlets. <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/top/docs/netnew080200.htm">Hungry to make their mark, online media roam GOP convention</a>, is the headline on a story by Mary Anne Ostrom of the Mercury News. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A13339-2000Jul31.html">At the Convention, a Dot-Com Manifesto</a>, says the headline writer for the Washington Post&#8217;s Howard Kurtz. </p>
<p>My impression, from afar, can be found in my <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg080200.htm">Wednesday column</a> in the Mercury News. <i>Aim 7 million cameras at a vacuous event, and it&#8217;s still vacuous.</i></p>
<p>
<blockquote>UPDATE: Becky Bond writes from <a href="http://www.workingforchange.com/news/index.cfm">NewsForChange</a>, a progressive Web site covering the Philadelphia convention. She points, in particular, to two stories:
<li><a href="www.newsforchange.com/rncprotest/">Protester says what?</a>. <i>&#8221;Republican Men Like Bush&#8221;<br />&#8221;Republican Women Like Men&#8221;<br />&#8211;A pair of buttons adoring the chest of a delegate who initiated a conversation about the importance of strong family values. 08.01.00</i>
<li><a href="http://www.workingforchange.com/news/article.cfm?ItemId=5301">Steal This Photo</a>. <i>Just download and upload. All we ask is that add a credit below the photograph that reads: copyleft 2000 newsforchange.com</i>.</p></blockquote>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>A Windows Price Increase?</font> </p>
<p>Remember, during the Microsoft trial, when Microsoft kept protesting that Windows was such a great deal because the price hadn&#8217;t risen? That was always a bogus claim, given that the marginal cost of making each new copy of Windows is almost zero to Microsoft &#8212; and it is precisely zero when the product is pre-loaded on a manufacturer&#8217;s computer for resale to a consumer or company.</p>
<p>Apart from a short-term promotional price of about $60, Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;street price&#8221; for Windows ME will be $109, or about $20 more than the street price for Windows 95. Only a monopolist could get away with charging that much for what amounts to a collection of bug fixes and minor enhancements.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Help Me Whack the PC Clock Gremlins</font> </p>
<p>Some piece of software in my computer has taken to resetting the internal clock. I leave the machine on during the night, and every morning, the computer&#8217;s clock is an hour behind the actual time.</p>
<p>Does anyone out there have any ideas what might be causing this? <span class="email-removed" title="email address removed">Let me know</span>. I&#8217;ll keep investigating, and will report back here what I learn.</p>

<p><font size=4>Hearst Gets the Chronicle</font> </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/chronicle/">San Francisco Chronicle</a>, now owned by Hearst Corp., says it intends to put out a world-class newspaper in the city. Good. San Francisco deserves better newspapers than the ones that have been the mainstays all these years.</p>
<p>The Chronicle and <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/examiner">Examiner</a> have their share of superb reporters and editors. Under the joint-operating agreement that had been in place, they put out two sub-par papers, because they didn&#8217;t individually have the resources to publish one excellent paper. Maybe, together, that will change.</p>
<p>Hearst has a lot to prove, beyond the fact that it doesn&#8217;t publish many respectable papers today. The way it has conducted itself in this buyout, making sleazy deals with politicians and alleged competitors, has been an ethical disgrace. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry to see the Examiner (at least the one we knew) die. But newspaper economics today are not condusive to having two major hometown dailies in a city like San Francisco.</p>
<p>Competition for the city and suburban readers won&#8217;t lag, however. My own paper is boosting its circulation in the city, adding reporters and editors and a special edition, and we compete hard in our Web presence. There are dozens of interesting Bay Area-related Web sites, magazines and smaller papers, and a variety of not broadcasting outlets.</p>
<p>All of this competitive activity is good for people who care about news. The competition improves the quality of the report. It should improve the quality of readers&#8217; lives if they care about newspapers.</p>
