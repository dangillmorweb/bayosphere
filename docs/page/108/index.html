				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>David Warsh, economics columnist for the Boston Globe, has written <a href="http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/163/business/Falsus_in_omnibus%2b.shtml">an important piece</a> about the Microsoft trial. He begins with a small but revealing misrepresentation by one of the company&#8217;s lawyers in court. Then he says:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><i>Dozens of these Microsoft moments occurred during the trial, at every stage, involving persons from chairman Bill Gates to his lawyers to his experts. The disabling of the Windows operating system out of spite after a judicial order to remove Internet Explorer. A faked videotape offered in evidence. The mumbled &#8221;I don&#8217;t remembers.&#8221; The unchanging protestations that the company had done nothing wrong.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Warsh details Microsoft&#8217;s assault on the legitimacy of government and the courts during this trial. He concludes: </p>
<p>
<blockquote><i>How will Microsoft&#8217;s conduct be thought of in terms of the history of the decade? As being profoundly dangerous to the rule of law. The case itself ultimately will be determined in the courts, of course. But its unprecedented attempt to purchase immunity in the administrative and legislative branches of government must be tried in the broader court of public opinion.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Tech companies are generally not paragons of trustworthiness. The tech industry is still in its adolescence, and it acts that way all too often.</p>
<p>But when it comes to mendacity and meanness, Microsoft may have no current peer. Its competitors and even its largest customers &#8212; the PC manufacturers &#8212; the have learned this over the years. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found it out for himself as he listened to the witnesses and looked at the evidence.</p>
<p>Reporters who cover Microsoft know it too. In 20 years in journalism I have never dealt with a company that has been more prone to deception and stonewalling than this one.</p>
<p>Last week, Bill Gates said he <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2584526,00.html">wished he&#8217;d testified</a> at the trial, so he could explain to the judge how much Microsoft has done for the world. More bull. David Boies and the government lawyers would have pulled him apart on the witness stand. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m so used to Microsoft&#8217;s disregard for the truth that I let little things just slip by. Here&#8217;s one I&#8217;d almost forgotten.</p>
<p>In a recent filing with the court, the government cited a previously unreleased Microsoft internal document strongly suggesting the company&#8217;s intention to continue behaving exactly in the ways that got it in trouble in the first place. A company spokesman trotted out the usual line &#8212; that the quote was just a snippet and was taken unfairly out of context. </p>
<p>Okay, I said to a Microsoft PR person, show it to us so we can see how the quote is out of context. I got no response. I asked again. No response. If I ever do get a reply, I&#8217;m sure the answer will be no.</p>
<p>Public opinion still holds Microsoft in high regard, if recent surveys are accurate. I don&#8217;t find this surprising, because Microsoft has spent millions massaging public opinion in its favor. If the average person ever deals closely with the company, the approval rating will drop like a plane with no wings.</p>
<p>In a vacuum, Microsoft&#8217;s untrustworthiness and arrogance would merely be a sad commentary on modern business practices. In the context of the company&#8217;s powerful position &#8212; and especially in light of its continuing assault on the rule of law and the democratic process &#8212; its behavior is downright dangerous.</p>
<p>UPDATE<br />
<blockquote>Jim Cullinan, a Microsoft spokesman, points out that the e-mail became an exhibit in the remedies phase of the antitrust trial and has been publicly posted on the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f4700/remedy1.pdf">Department of Justice Web site</a> (PDF document; requires software reader). Read it and decide for yourself what it suggests about the company&#8217;s intentions.</p></blockquote>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Digital Signatures &#8212; Not So Fast</font> </p>
<p>It&#8217;s looking as though Congress will pass a law making <a href=" http://www.mercurycenter.com/premium/nation/docs/085770.htm">digital signatures legally binding</a> (Mercury News) in transactions between companies and their customers. This isn&#8217;t a bad idea, but <a href=" http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c106:4:./temp/~c106mVjHNS::">the legislation</a> is moving too quickly for my tastes.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s going to store the database of signatures? The government? A company? A priest? My brother? Me? </p>
<p>Who will guarantee that the encryption method is safe from hackers, that our signature keys are secure? The government? A company? A priest? My brother? Me? </p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t this just an invitation for digital fraud? If someone empties my bank account, do I have to prove I didn&#8217;t do it? </p>
<p>Is it really an opt-in system? When a company &#8220;notifies&#8221; you in the fine print of an &#8220;I accept&#8221; click-through software license agreement that it&#8217;s now dealing with you only electronically, is that valid? </p>
<p>The legislation does consider many of these issues, but not sufficiently for my taste. Let&#8217;s slow down on digital signatures. There&#8217;s no need to rush into this.</p>

				<p>  Many of Silicon Valley&#8217;s most high-profile people, including some of the top innovators, have shown they care about more than technology. They care as well about the community. And it&#8217;s good when they&#8217;re recognized.</p>
<p>   The winners at the third annual tech Visionary Awards, handed out this week in San Jose, were all impressive in their business and technology achievements. But their efforts in giving back to the community were also notable, according to the <a href="http://www.sdforum.org">Software Development Foundation</a>, which runs the event..</p>
<p>   It took place at the Egyptian Museum (the venue&#8217;s significance eluded me). Prior winners had included Microsoft&#8217;s Bill Gates, eBay&#8217;s Pierre Omidyar and others whose name you&#8217;d recognize. </p>
<p>   In alphabetical order, this year&#8217;s winners were Ron Conway, a longtime entrepreneur and investor; Steve Kirsch, founder of several companies including Frame Technology and Infoseek, and one of the valley&#8217;s most active philanthropists; Charles M. Geschke, co-founder and co-chairman at Adobe Systems; Gerald W. Kearby, co-founder and chief executive at Liquid Audio; Alain Rossmann, founder and CEO of Phone.com; Larry Sonsini, whose Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich &#038; Rosati became the valley&#8217;s premier law firm; and John Warnock, Adobe co-founder, co-chairman and CEO. (For details, <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/PR/PR_060700.htm">click here</a>.)</p>
<p>   Congratulations to all of them.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Another View on Microsoft </font> </p>
<p>Chuck Dietrick, general manager for Microsoft&#8217;s Enterprise Services Group, took strong exception to my <a href="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/2000/06/07"> reaction to the court ruling</a> that the company should be broken up. Note: He emphasizes that this is a personal opinion, not necessarily the view of the company.</p>
<p>
<blockquote> <i>Dan, you are guilty of the exact same thing of which you accuse Bill Gates&#8230;refusing to acquiesce if/when proven to be wrong.  Your less than fair, and highly arrogant supposition is that if the lower court ruling is overturned, it can only be the result of a breakdown in the antitrust lawsthemselves&#8230;in essence, an abolition of the rules. </p>
<p>You continually pilloryMicrosoft over an inability to admit wrongdoing and accept &#8220;the rule oflaw&#8221;, yet you have the temerity to turn around and say that if yourlongstanding position is proven to be invalid by a court of law, that youare, in effect, still right, and the laws and/or court system is flawed.  Iview that as exceptionally hypocritical.  For somebody who views himself ashigh integrity, and the protector of all that is right and good, I&#8217;ll expectyou to behave just as you continually preach that Microsoft should behave ifMicrosoft does prevail on appeal.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>My response: If Microsoft prevails on appeal, that won&#8217;t change the fact that the company has behaved in a less-than-honorable fashion again and again in its history. Such a ruling would be evidence that the antitrust laws are no longer adequate in the modern world. </p>
<p>But we should be clear on something. A Microsoft victory in this case would mean that antitrust laws do not apply to the software business. Period. It would be useful if Microsoft acknowledged this.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Rich Markwart writes: <i>So, where does Bill go when he feels he&#8217;s getting the raw deal on competition?</p>

				<p>Judge Jackson&#8217;s Microsoft ruling culminates a sad trail of <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg060800.htm">missed opportunities </a>, from my perspective.</p>

<p><font size=4>Bidder&#8217;s Edge Fights Back Against eBay</font> </p>
<p>EBay dominates the online auction market, and has used monopolistic tactics to keep others from getting a piece of the pie. It took Bidder&#8217;s Edge to court for daring to expose and compare auction prices on various Web sites, and got a favorable ruling &#8212; an unfortunate decision that helped only eBay, not consumers.</p>
<p>Now Bidder&#8217;s Edge has come up with a new tactic. It&#8217;s offering a special <a href="http://www.biddersedge.com/ebayupdate.jsp">&#8220;eBay search function&#8221;</a> that, according to Bidder&#8217;s Edge, complies with the court ruling but still allows comparison shopping. Clever.</p>

				<p>Disappointingly, our favorite monopolist says it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/064801.htm">not fleeing to Canada</a>, despite reports that the British Columbia authorities had invited Microsoft to move there.</p>
<p>The main problem with leaving the country is that the U.S. government and assorted private lawyers wouldn&#8217;t simply roll over and say, &#8220;Okay, you win, no more antitrust suits.&#8221; This government has been known, after all, to pursue even heads of state &#8212; witness our highjacking of Panama&#8217;s dictator on drug-trafficking charges a few years ago.</p>
<p>No, to get away for good, Microsoft will need to find a place that no one else can find. How about Gilligan&#8217;s Island?</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Support the Janitors</font> </p>
<p>The incredible wealth spawned by Silicon Valley should be a source of shame when we look at the way companies treat the janitors who work so hard for so little. Read K. Oanh Ha&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/front/docs/janit060200.htm">story</a> in today&#8217;s Mercury News and see if you can justify this situation.</p>
<p>The excuses, of couse, are the usual ones. Janitorial work isn&#8217;t highly skilled, which is true. But that&#8217;s only a part of it. Here&#8217;s another reason: Big, rich companies subcontract their work to third parties, giving them deniability when people ask why they treat the janitors with such indifference.</p>
<p>There is not the slightest sense of community in Silicon Valley these days. The place is going to be nothing but a traffic-choked office park where the wealthiest of the world congregate, including 20-somethings who&#8217;ve struck it rich with such surprise. I wonder who&#8217;ll take out the trash. Maybe they can hire their mothers or fathers.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Michael McKay comments: <i>I worked my way through college in the mid-80s as a security guard at General Electric (the Nuclear Energy Business Operations plant on Monterey and Curtner).  I always found it amusing that the lowest paid janitor was paid more than the Graveyard security guard manager. That&#8217;s right, the person in charge of the plant for the first 30 minutes (or so) of any emergency was being paid less a starting janitor. I sympathize with the janitors, but they are hardly alone in being underpaid.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Judge Jackson wisely granted the parties <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/top/docs/ms060200.htm">a little more time</a> (Mercury News) to file final arguments in the antitrust trial. He plainly wants to just issue his ruling, however, and be done with it.</p>
<p>This makes some sense, actually. The most important question for the appeals court is not whether a breakup is a good or bad idea, but whether the verdict &#8212; the findings of law &#8212; should be upheld or overtured. If it&#8217;s upheld, then you worry about the penalty. </p>
<p>If the verdict is overturned, antitrust law does not apply to software, period. Which would mean it does not apply to much of anything in the long run. Worth thinking about&#8230;</p>

				<p>Give Microsoft credit for one thing &#8212; persistence. Its <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/trial/may00/05-31comments.asp">final brief</a> in the landmark antitrust trial was more of the same bluster and refusal to acknowledge any reality but its own we-are-the-universe point of view.</p>
<p>Most amazing, however, was a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/trial/may00/05-31offerproof.asp">&#8220;Supplemental Order of Proof&#8221;</a> that accompanied the brief. This contained statements putting words in the mouths of Microsoft corporate customers and academic allies &#8212; e.g. &#8220;Microsoft anticipates that Mr. Capellas would testify to the following general propositions at an evidentiary hearing.&#8221; (Capellas is Michael Capellas, CEO of Compaq, which pretty much lives at the whim of Microsoft, so he&#8217;s definitely a trustworthy source in this regard.)</p>
<p>The statements were hilarious in several cases because they effectively said the market needs &#8212; I am not making this up &#8212; <i>less competition</i>. Apparently monopoly is less confusing to consumers when it&#8217;s easier for the company controlling the market to add features and integrate them into the product.</p>
<p>Actually, Microsoft did the government a favor in this absurd filing. It backed the government&#8217;s fundamental points, brilliantly.</p>
