<p>Sunday, Nov. 14 &#8212;</p>
<p>In 1997, just before the onset of the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/longterm/asiaecon/keystories.htm">Asian financial crisis</a>, Hanson Cheah and James Yao co-founded AsiaTech Ventures Ltd. Their timing, in retrospect, was perfect. </p>
<p>Cheah and Yao are among a new, young breed of venture capitalists who see Asia as a fertile ground for technology entrepreneurs. They&#8217;re putting investors&#8217; money where their ideas are, and the results so far have been spectacular &#8212; major-league returns in several of their funds.</p>
<p>I met with Cheah, Yao and several of their colleagues here in Hong Kong, and came away impressed with their abilities and accomplishments. Find out more in my <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg111499.htm">Sunday column</a>, one element in the Mercury News&#8217; quarterly <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/companies/moneytree/">Money Tree</a> venture capital survey.</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/placeholder.png" orig-SRC="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/picture$107" align="left"   ALT="Photo of Hong Kong from Victoria Peak"></p>
<p>Sunday, Nov. 14 &#8212;</p>
<p>For the fourth or fifth time since arriving in Hong Kong I walked from my residence at the university to <a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/J_Morris/sights.htm">Victoria Peak</a>, the famous summit that overlooks central Hong Kong, the harbor and Kowloon. It&#8217;s an easy hike, just under two miles up a not-too-steep road and pathway, ideal for a little exercise and reflection.</p>
<p>The view from the peak is a scene from a postcard. It&#8217;s best, everyone says, when the air is clear. I haven&#8217;t seen such a day yet. Hong Kong&#8217;s pollution could eventually become as famous as its spectacular backdrops if the powers-that-be don&#8217;t get serious, soon, about the increasingly dismal air quality. Downtown, some pedestrians wear cloth or gauze filters over their mouth and nose as they walk amid the buses, trucks and cars that spew garbage into the air.</p>
<p>On a sunny Sunday, even the haze and smog can&#8217;t ultimately ruin the view. Boats make their way in seeming slow motion around the harbor. Looking down onto the skyscrapers, no people are visible, only a magnificent city.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/placeholder.png" orig-SRC="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/picture$106" align="left"   ALT="Photo of Filipino women in the central square"></p>
<p>Central Hong Kong is bursting with people each Sunday. Most of them are Filipino women. They are maids and nannies six days a week, and Sunday is their day off.</p>
<p>Many of these women are highly educated and held professional positions back home. But the economy in the Philippines is a mess, and they can make much more money as maids in well-to-do Chinese and expatriate households. So they leave their skilled jobs to come here for work that is, by comparison, menial. They also leave their husbands and children for months on end, to work and live in a culture that regards and often treats them with disrespect. They are making the best of an unfair situation, but their choices are cruel.</p>
<p>The women come to the square next to the domed legislature building, and to other gathering places downtown. They visit with each other. They do some shopping. They read. They line up at the pay phones to call home. They have nowhere else to go today.</p>
<p>I see sadness and loneliness in many eyes.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ietf.org">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (IETF) has told governments worldwide that it won&#8217;t do the bidding of spy and law-enforcement agencies as it writes new standards for moving data around the Net. But don&#8217;t assume this fight is over. It&#8217;s just beginning.</p>
<p>The FBI and other organizations want wiretapping to be as much a part of the next-generation Internet as e-mail itself. A 1994 U.S. law requires telecommunications companies to build wiretapping capabilities into their systems, but the IETF decided not to create features in upcoming Internet protocols that had no other purpose.</p>
<p>For more information:</p>

<p>Ding and several of his associates flew to Hong Kong yesterday from Beijing for a series of meetings, including one with me. I don&#8217;t have enough of a feel yet for the China portal market to know if they&#8217;re going to be one of the companies that makes it. But before I leave here, I hope to have learned enough to at least tell you more about how this ultra-competitive arena is shaping up.</p>

				<p>Thursday, Nov. 11 &#8212;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Silicon Valley&#8217;s center of business gravity has shifted toward the networked world. Venture capital is flowing toward Internet and networking companies, not older-line businesses based on personal computers &#8212; and not solely because the Intel-Microsoft &#8220;Win-Tel&#8221; duopoly has been squeezing out other people&#8217;s innovations in the PC arena.</p>
<p>Even so, it was remarkable to see <a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/data/squote2.htx?source=blq/SJMercury&#038;ticker=INTC&#038;tables=extend&#038;slug=squote">Intel</a> dropping behind another Silicon Valley company in its market capitalization. <a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/data/squote2.htx?source=blq/SJMercury&#038;ticker=CSCO&#038;tables=extend&#038;slug=squote">Cisco Systems&#8217;</a> ascent is the best evidence yet of the shifts taking place in technology.</p>
<p>The two companies took largely different paths to prominence. Intel grew by taking enormous risks &#8212; building new plants to sell ever-more-powerful chips and hoping the customers would be there when the chips hit the market. Cisco, to a much greater extent, has acquired technology to complement its organic growth.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Intel sees its future as a supplier to the networked world, too. This race isn&#8217;t over.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Echelon </font></p>
<p>Thursday, Nov. 11 &#8212;</p>
<p>Various governments deny its very existence, but <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/daily/990523/news/news3.html">Echelon</a> &#8212; a global electronic spying network &#8212; is increasingly looking like a genuine item.  Its apparent purpose is to intercept international communications on behalf of intelligence agencies, in part to tip off national-security people to potential terrorist threats.</p>
<p>Of course, such a system can also be used for everyday spying on everyday businesses and citizens who aren&#8217;t even suspected of doing anything wrong. The potential for massive, unwarranted invasions of privacy has prompted politicians in several countries to start asking questions, which have largely been greeted by stonewalling from intelligence services.</p>
<p>The U.S. National Security Agency, for example, told Congress to take a hike when a few members asked for information on Echelon. This is pretty brazen behavior, but Congress rarely has the guts to pursue even the worst civil-liberties abuses when the military or intelligence community cover themselves in the cloak of national security.</p>
<p>Duncan Campbell, a Scottish journalist, has been writing about Echelon longer than anyone else in the press. His <a href="http://www.iptvreports.mcmail.com/stoa_cover.htm">report to the European Parliament</a> on international message interception remains one of the best sources of information on this topic. </p>
<p>If you want to know more, Campbell will be one of the speakers at a meeting of the <a href="http://www.freedomfighter.net/cypherpunks/991113.html">Bay Area Cypherpunks</a> on Saturday in Palo Alto. It runs from 12:30 p.m. until 5 p.m. at the Gates computer-science building at Stanford University.</p>

				<p>Wednesday, Nov. 10 &#8212;</p>
<p>The financial-services legislation that will soon become law is a disaster in the making. Among other bad impacts, it creates huge new risks in the technology-driven financial system. It will let commercial banks, insurance companies, investment banks, brokerages and other financial institutions buy each other and go into each others&#8217; markets. Congress didn&#8217;t beef up regulatory oversight to match the heightened incentives for financial institutions to take scary chances with customers&#8217; &#8212; and ultimately taxpayers&#8217; &#8212; money. The legislation also guts the valuable 1977 Community Reinvestment Act requirements that helped ensure at least some lending in poorer areas.</p>
<p>Big Money, in the form of bribes to politicians &#8212; sorry, I should say &#8220;campaign contributions&#8221; &#8212; has again carried the day. It&#8217;s a disgrace.</p>
<p>But bad macroeconomic policy isn&#8217;t the only problem. At the behest of the big-money interests, customer privacy has been left out of this legislation. Congress gutted provisions that would have forced the financial institutions to ask our permission before sharing data with other parts of their conglomerates.</p>
<p>So now, if your bank is in bed with an insurance company and mortage company, your medical information may be shared with your banker. Your credit-card information may go to your life-insurance company. Your tax return (required with most mortgage applications) will find its way to everyone. And so on. </p>
<p>The alleged benefits of this law are one-stop shopping for financial services. That&#8217;s a crock. Technology will soon give us all a way to create a shopping basket of discrete financial services without putting all of our eggs, and most sensitive personal information, in the hands of people who see us more and more as data to be churned, and less and less as human beings.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only one thing you can do about this. You can move your various accounts into institutions that are <i>not</i> part of giant financial conglomerates. That&#8217;s my plan.</p>
<p>Goodbye, Wells Fargo. You got what you wanted from Congress. Now you&#8217;re going to get what you deserve from me &#8212; one less customer.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a cross between a flea market and a retail store &#8212; a multi-floor grab-bag of shops selling all kinds of computer-related goods and accessories. </p>
<p>It makes a lot of sense, actually. A great deal of the world&#8217;s PC and peripheral manufacturing is done here in Taiwan, and it&#8217;s natural that some of those goods make their way into the local consumer market.</p>
<p>Some of the shops inside this building are little more than cubby-holes. Others are somewhat bigger. Collectively they add up to a serious selection of goods, ranging from PCs  (especially laptops) to software, CD-ROM drives, add-in cards, chips, memory, motherboards and more. At least one of the stores was selling video CDs and DVDs at, shall we say, very low prices.</p>
<p>Some of the personal technology here and in Hong Kong is truly remarkable. Stay tuned for a report on Asian gadgets. </p>
<p>P.S. For those of you not in the Bay Area, Fry&#8217;s is the Silicon Valley-based chain of gigantic computer and electronics supermarkets.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Ballmer&#8217;s Turn</font></p>
<p>It looks like Steve Ballmer, president of Microsoft Corp., has been designated as the principal front man in the company&#8217;s campaign to explain away its growing legal troubles. This makes sense, given Bill Gates&#8217; total lack of credibility at this point. Ballmer wasn&#8217;t a witness at the antitrust trial in Washington, and as far as I can tell, his deposition testimony, if he gave any, hasn&#8217;t been made public.</p>
<p>I found Ballmer&#8217;s latest contribution to the public debate in the Asian Wall Street Journal this morning. In a piece on the newspaper&#8217;s editorial page, Ballmer (or whoever wrote the column for him) trots out the usual arguments to support the idea that his company a) is in imminent danger of demise due to the efforts of the Linux community and other enemies; b) behaves with utter integrity; and c) really, really wants to resolve this matter.</p>
<p>He recites the standard company mantra: &#8220;Microsoft is standing up for a fundamental principle on which the entire high-technology industry is built &#8212; the freedom to innovate and create competitive new products that better meet our customers&#8217; needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later, he notes that Microsoft is &#8220;held to a very high standard of conduct.&#8221; That&#8217;s interesting language. Obviously, given the evidence, Microsoft doesn&#8217;t hold itself to a high standard of conduct. Luckily for Microsoft&#8217;s customers and the future of free enterprise in America, the Department of Justice, state attorneys general and other people have intervened in this regard.</p>
<p>In fact, Microsoft is standing up for the fundamentally ugly principles on which it was built &#8212; the right to monopolize its market; brutalize any potential competition by using its monopoly power; and eliminate antitrust enforcement in the Digital Age. </p>
<p>Ballmer is right about at least one thing. The stakes are high.</p>

				<p>Expect a raft of new antitrust cases &#8212; including some that are utterly without merit, as public-relations people are trained to say &#8212; against Microsoft now that a federal judge has declared the company to be a monopoly. That judicial finding greatly eases the burden for anyone bringing such a case.</p>
<p>One especially interesting antitrust suit has been brewing for some time now. It was brought by Caldera Inc. over a long-moribund operating system called DR DOS, which was in many ways better than Microsoft&#8217;s MS-DOS but got squashed by you know who. I talk about this and other things in <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg110999.htm">Tuesday&#8217;s column</a>.</p>

<p><font size=4>Taipei</font></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been meeting with some technology folks here in Taiwan&#8217;s capital. They&#8217;re full of energy and ambition, just like the people in another place I know.</p>
<p>Taipei is a frenetic place. The traffic reminds me of Tel Aviv, Israel, where the morning and evening rush hours are mind-boggling and make Silicon Valley&#8217;s congestion seem almost moderate.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/placeholder.png" orig-SRC="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/picture$97" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 BORDER=0 align="left" ALT="Scooters -- a popular way to get around Taipei"></a></p>
<p>As a result, motor scooters and motorcycles seem to be the most popular way to get around. But the people who drive these things take incredible chances. Each of my last four taxi rides involved a near-collision when a motorcyclist went this-a-way while traffic was heading that-a-way. Scary. </p>
<p>Taipei suffered relatively little harm in the terrible September earthquake, but the southern part of the island was mauled. I won&#8217;t have the opportunity to visit the worst-hit places, but the quake remains on people&#8217;s minds in a serious way. Taiwan has gotten itself back in gear quickly as a whole, but for many thousands of people the return to normal life will be long and difficult.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>TRUSTe? Strike Five </font></p>
<p>TRUSTe presents itself as a steward of Web privacy for consumers. Based on the record so far, the organization gets a failing grade.</p>
<p>In the latest example, <a href="http://www.truste.org">TRUSTe</a> again finds itself mostly helpless in the face of a member&#8217;s egregious violation of its customers&#8217; privacy. You&#8217;ll recall that RealNetworks, without telling customers, was using its RealJukebox player to surreptitiously send information on users&#8217; music-listening habits back to the company&#8217;s computers. A huge error, said RealNetworks, which had boasted the TRUSTe seal denoting solid privacy practices.</p>
<p>TRUSTe basically <a href="http://www.truste.org/about/about_software.html">ducked again</a>, saying RealNetworks&#8217; violation technically didn&#8217;t violate TRUSTe&#8217;s guidelines. The organization did persuade RealNetworks to try to do a better job in the future.</p>
<p>I still like the idea of TRUSTe, but increasingly it&#8217;s clear that we also need privacy-enhancing laws, not just self-regulation that Net companies flout with impunity.</p>

<p>Americans, in our provincial way, tend to think we&#8217;re world leaders in every technological field. Wrong.</p>
<p>The U.S. is miserably behind Europe and Asia when it comes to wireless and especially wireless data. I&#8217;ve been learning this first-hand, and explain what I mean in my <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg110799.htm">Sunday column</a>.</p>

<p>Cathay Pacific, the airline I flew a few hours ago from Hong Kong to Taipei, has video screens at every coach seat on its Boeing 777s. One of the channels shows the view from a camera mounted on the bottom of the fuselage, just back of the forward wheels.</p>
<p>The camera stays on from pushback at the originating gate until the plane pulls up to its arrival gate. The view is pretty boring when you&#8217;re flying over the South China Sea, but it&#8217;s a lot of fun to watch the takeoff and landing. I snapped this picture of the screen just after takeoff.</p>

				<p>Saturday, Nov. 6 &#8212;</p>
<p>Something important happened yesterday. A federal judge, appointed by the president most opposed to the enforcement of antitrust laws in recent times, <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dgms110699.htm">said what is obvious</a> to anyone with an ounce of common sense: Microsoft has a monopoly in the operating-systems market, and has systematically used &#8212; I believe the correct word is &#8220;abused&#8221; &#8212; its position to stomp out competition.</p>
<p>This plain truth, part of the court&#8217;s &#8220;findings of fact,&#8221; is a victory for the free-market system. It is not a victory for the blind-to-reality libertarians who can&#8217;t bring themselves to find any flaw with capitalism. </p>
<p>It now seems likely the court will find Microsoft guilty of antitrust violations under the law. And that will raise the question of penalty.</p>
<p>If you were the court, <span class="email-removed" title="email address removed">what would you do</span>? </p>

<p><font size=4>Is Hank Rolling in his Grave? </font></p>

<p>This band was playing Friday night in a Hong Kong restaurant/club that attracts well-off locals, tourists and expatriates. When I took this picture, the musicians were in the middle of a Hank Williams song, &#8220;Your Cheatin&#8217; Heart.&#8221; </p>
<p>No, they didn&#8217;t play it very well. But the musicians were no slouches. Earlier, they&#8217;d been playing the songs that filled Shanghai nightclubs in the 1930s, and that was wonderful.</p>
<p>I liked the Williams tune, anyway. It was one of those bizarre and, in its own way, delicious cross-cultural moments. And no, I think Hank Williams would be happy to hear it, too, because he wrote his music for all people.</p>

				<p>Thursday, Nov. 4 &#8212;</p>
<p>The Internet is beginning to bloom in a big way here, but everything is relative. Hong Kong reminds me of New York and San Francisco three or four years ago, when it was obvious the Net was going to change things and smart people began to figure out how they could get a piece of the action.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/placeholder.png" orig-SRC="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/picture$85"   align="left" width="268" height="198" ALT="A booth at Internet World Asia"></a>I stopped by the Internet World Asia trade show. It&#8217;s a junior &#8212; very junior &#8212; version of the increasingly behemoth Internet World shows in the United States. </p>
<p>The exhibits fill a relatively small hall on the seventh level of the Hong Kong Convention Center, but the panel sessions are well attended. A sign of the Asian times: Another journalist tells me it was standing room only at the session on Internet stock valuations.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/placeholder.png" orig-SRC="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/picture$86" align="left" width="278" height="222" ALT="Intel Booth at Internet World Asia"></a>Intel had a huge booth, relatively speaking. Some of the computers in the booth showed the Chinese language, but otherwise the booth was pure English. That was a great demonstration of two things: economic imperialism and the reality that, so far, English is the most common tongue in technology.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p> <font size=4>What Silicon Valley Thinks of Asia </font></p>
<p>Thursday, Nov. 4 &#8212;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of  the topics of my talk tomorrow at the Foreign Correspondents Club. I&#8217;m still working on this speech, but I&#8217;ll certainly be noting some ironies in that overly broad notion.</p>
<p>First, Asia is many places &#8212; Japan, Singapore, India, China and all the others. Of course, China is many places, too &#8212; Hong Kong, Taiwan and the mainland (which is also many places). Second, depending on who you are and where you are, Asia is a supplier, marketplace or competitor, often several of those.</p>
<p>This gets granular pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I also have to talk about how Silicon Valley looks from the inside. That&#8217;s easier, though I suspect there are only about three people who genuinely understand the place. And they&#8217;re not talking.</p>

				<p>Wednesday, Nov. 3 &#8212;</p>
<p>A third of the way around the world from home, I&#8217;m at least as well connected in Hong Kong &#8212; and maybe better &#8212; than at home.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong University guest residence where I&#8217;m staying has Ethernet ports in every room. I got an Internet proxy setting from the university computer folks, put it into my browser and <i>voila</i>, I was online.</p>
<p>But in many ways the most formidable connection is the one I&#8217;m carrying around: a mobile phone. It&#8217;s uses the GSM digital system here, and is astoundingly clear. I called my boss and the signal was almost as good as calling from home in California.</p>
<p>One of Hong Kong&#8217;s serious bragging rights is its wireless capabilities, among the most advanced in the world. The density of the population, plus fierce competition in the local market, have combined for some outstanding service and rates. And the best is yet to come.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to a Nokia announcement regarding its soon-to-be-launched services using the <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/wap/">Wireless Application Protocol</a>, also known as WAP (the link goes to some Nokia propaganda but it&#8217;s useful for background). Like everything new in technology, WAP has been over-hyped, but it does seem likely to transform wireless communications in coming years.</p>
<p>In Sunday&#8217;s column I&#8217;ll tell you more about WAP and Hong Kong&#8217;s remarkable mobile communications capabilities. I&#8217;ll also tell you why the U.S. is pathetically behind the curve.</p>

<p><font size=4>Scott Talks</font></p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/placeholder.png" orig-SRC="http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/picture$82" width="360" height="270" alt="Scott McNealy talks to Sun customers"></a></p>
<p>Wednesday, Nov. 3 &#8212;</p>
<p>I mentioned yesterday that Scott McNealy, chief executive at Sun Microsystems, was in Hong Kong, less than a week after Microsoft President Steve Ballmer came through. Both announced deals with major telecom and real-estate interests. Ballmer couldn&#8217;t fit me into his schedule, and I was denied access to a daylong conference co-sponsored by Dow Jones and Microsoft.</p>
<p>McNealy was more willing to talk. At a luncheon Tuesday with major Sun customers from this part of the world, he pounded hard on his longstanding insistence that computing and communications are moving away from the Microsoft-dominated systems of today. The complexity belongs on the network, he said, not in the PC. You&#8217;ve heard that before.</p>
<p>But at lunch and in a conversation afterward (in the Presidential Suite of the Grand Hyatt &#8212; amazing digs, and an <i>awesome</i> view), McNealy had some interesting things to add. Sure, some of it was the typical McNealy overstatement of reality, but whatever he and his colleagues are doing these days is clearly working.</p>
<p>Uncharacteristically, McNealy acknowledged that the network computer in its early incarnation was a failure. &#8220;We weren&#8217;t very good at it the first time,&#8221; he said. Besides, &#8220;nobody wanted to give up the PC&#8230;and (its) productivity tools, and nobody trusted networks&#8221; to be reliable enough.</p>
<p>The latest network computer from Sun, dubbed the Sun Ray, is the ultimate in a thin client. There&#8217;s no microprocessor, no operating system or main memory, just a display engine that renders what&#8217;s coming down from the server computer. The model to think about with Sun Ray, McNealy says, is a TV tuner and receiver, where every Sun Ray is effectively gets its own private channel from the server.</p>
<p>&#8220;This one&#8217;s going to do better,&#8221; he said, adding an intriguing caveat. He noted that Windows went essentially nowhere until it hit version 3.1, and suggested Sun Ray is at about 2.5 on the network-computer scale at the moment &#8212; there&#8217;s still a lot of work to do, he implied.</p>
<p>Sun may not approve of Microsoft or its business practices, but lately it&#8217;s been working hard to emulate one of Microsoft&#8217;s chief assets: soup-to-nuts productivity software and development tools. McNealy said Sun has assembled some major pieces. He noted several recent acquisitions including <a href="http://www.sun.com/staroffice/">Star Division</a> (StarOffice productivity software), Forte (e-business applications) and NetBeans (Java tools). </p>
<p>The StarOffice deal has received the most attention, as it&#8217;s the most direct challenge yet to Microsoft from Sun, which is giving the software away. If Sun somehow captures a majority of the market this way, it&#8217;ll be inviting scrutiny from the Justice Department&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.netbeans.com/">NetBeans</a> is especially intriguing. I first met the NetBeans more than a year ago, when they stopped by my office in San Jose to show me their Java development toolkit. It blew me away, and has only gotten better.</p>
<p>Java has become a favored language, especially on the server. I think Java has a real chance to make inroads on some kinds of client devices, though I doubt it&#8217;ll ever be all that useful on PCs, given the horrible compatibility problems on various Java virtual machines (the layer of software, typically included in Web browsers, in which Java applications run), not to mention Microsoft&#8217;s largely successful moves to poison the atmosphere for consistent client Java applications.</p>
<p>Still, Sun is beginning to tell an interesting story for developers. It has a long, long way to go before it&#8217;ll begin to match Microsoft-style care and feeding of programmers, but the progress is real.</p>

<p>I went to an announcement of a new Java venture capital fund, and guess who&#8217;s part of the show: Scott McNealy, Sun Microsystems&#8217; CEO. Here, he&#8217;s schmoozing with some of Sun&#8217;s biggest Hong Kong customers.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t speak at the press conference, though he spoke privately with other Java Fund investors. After talking with his customers at lunch (&#8220;A free lunch,&#8221; he claimed), he visited briefly with me and Michelle Levander, a former Mercury News reporter who&#8217;s now technology editor of the Asian Wall Street Journal.
