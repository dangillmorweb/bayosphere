<p>Whether or not they win the Series isn&#8217;t as important as knowing the Yankees are suffering.</p>
<p>When someone heard I was rooting for the Sox, she said, &#8220;But you&#8217;re from New York!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Golden Boy of Boston will revert to form and lose the election.</p>
<p>You can hope, pathetically, for another outcome.  But it&#8217;s as foolhardy as betting on the Red Sox.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never felt compelled to comment in this blog despite violent disagreement with many of the positions here but I need to address query&#8217;s comment:<br />Please don&#8217;t associate the Red Sox, who are loved by republicans, democrats, conservatives, liberals, and all of the kooks in between with John Kerry&#8230;That&#8217;s just a cheap shot at the expense of all Red Sox fans&#8230;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t associate the team with John Kerry.</p>
<p>I associate Dan Gillmor&#8217;s blind allegiance to something so out of the mainstream (in terms of performance and competence) about both the team and the man.</p>

<p>Ease up on query&#8230;taking shots at somebody with his obvious intellectual and emotional problems is akin to beating somebody with a broken leg for not running the Boston Marathon fast enough. He may be slow, graceless and not very smart, but at least he&#8217;s involved, which is more than we can say for many of our citizens. Go around him, ignore or pity him, and pray that he gets better. </p>

<p>We Cub fans desperately want the Red Sox to win the Series!<br />We are sick and tired of you Baahstan whiners saying you&#8217;re the most cursed team in sports.<br />The Bosox have been to the Series FIVE TIMES, including this year, since 1945!<br />The truly, deeply cursed Cubs have been there a grand total of ZERO, REPEAT, ZERO times since then. And the only reason the Cubs made it then was because it was World War II and many of the best players were in the military.<br />Plus, Harry Frazee didn&#8217;t sell Babe Ruth in 1920 to the Yankees so he could invest in &#8220;No,No,Nannette. That play didn&#8217;t come out until 1925. See the George Vecsey column in the Sept. 25, 2004 NY Times for the deflation of that myth. <br />But Sianis really did try to bring the billy goat into Wrigley Field in 1945 and Sianis did put a Greek curse on the Cubs for that.</p>

<p>I recently came across a possible tech explanation for the Boston Curse in a fine book called _Regional Advantage_ by AnnaLee Saxenian.   The book is mostly about why Silicon Valley beat out Route 128 (summary: it&#8217;s the social networking).  One chapter mentions that in the late 1940&#8217;s when William Shockley left Bell Labs, he tried to get Raytheon, Massachusetts&#8217; largest tube company, to invest in his new venture.    Raytheon turned him down!   So Shockley came out to the Bay Area, and the rest is history, both for the Sox and Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s this Ruth guy anyway?</p>

<p>&#8220;allegiance to something so out of the mainstream (in terms of performance and competence) about both the team and the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Putting Kerry aside &#8211; c&#8217;mon, what kind of pinhead has to bring up partisan politics no matter what the subject &#8211; query shows himself damn ignorant about baseball. The Sox have been putting a great product on the field for a long time now. You gotta go pre-1967 to find perennial crappy Sox teams. </p>
<p>E.g. the Houston Astros have been around for over 40 years and this would have been their first World Series if they&#8217;d won tonight. Know any Cubs fans? Etc. etc.</p>
<p>Also, unlike query, Sox fans actually love something outside of their partisan politics, their stock portfolios or religion &#8211; their beloved Sawx. It&#8217;s a wonderful common bond among New Englanders, young and old.</p>
<p>It will be very special and very sweet if they beat the Cards.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s such a shame that the celebrations were marred by the increasingly-standard rioting and that a young woman was killed by a police officer during the fracas.  Whatever happened to the days of my youth when a championship (pennant, etc.) meant crowds at the airport to welcome the conquering heroes followed by a parade and a celebration at the biggest park in the city?  Why do so many punkasses think that burning couches and overturning police cars is appropriate?</p>
<p>Oh, and go Cards.  (Sorry, too many years just up the road from St. Lou.)</p>

<p>Empty headed liberal tripe, by the architect of so much disasterous policy of the 1960s that lead, ultimately, to the Democrats disasterous Vietnam conflict and buildup, under their leadership, to a force of over half a million American troops.</p>
<p>His guilt and remorse is now, it seems, worn on his sleeve &#8212; for so many lives lossed senselessly in Southeast Asia (given our hasty withdrawal and the failure of the Democrats to authorize air support for the South Vietnamese after the Kerry-approved peace accords).  </p>
<p>Millions of Vietnamese and many millions more in neighboring Cambodia died after our withdrawal, and the blood is on the hands of John F. Kennedy&#8217;s braintrust, including Schlesinger, that launched the exercise so wrongly and half-heartedly.</p>
<p>He shows the same disingenous use of language, frankly, as George W. Bush in the 2000 debates, when he said he supports &#8220;affirmative access&#8221;, instead of proclaiming outright his opposition to affirmative action, the remaining barrier to a color-blind society imposed by racist, socialist levelers on the Left.</p>
<p>Schlesinger and Kerry both support as near an immediate and ignomious withdrawal from Iraq as you could possibly imagine.  Their burden of proof for U.S. use-of-force abroad does NOT, most certainly does NOT permit this country to take the fight to the terrorists.  </p>
<p>When another U.S. city is hit with another weapon of mass destruction (the airplane impact and explosion delivered the equivalent of a tactical nuclear warhead into the World Trade Centers), a President Kerry would convene the UN Security Council, and engage in months of deliberation.</p>
<p>Under Kerry, Saddam would not only still be in power, he&#8217;d hold dominion over Kuwait *and* Saudi Arabia, which was his objective in 1990 when Kerry voted against the most complete international coalition in modern times to repel Saddam.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s send Kerry back to Massachussetts.  I&#8217;ll be looking for him on the syllabus as an instructor for the Kennedy School of Government in 2006.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been sort of following this podcasting storm.<br />It is really very interesting.</p>
<p>It appears to be happening at a bittorrent rate (a phrase which I suggest should mean exponential^exponential).</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to ask a question:</p>
<p>Could the same thing be done for television what is being done for radio?</p>

<p>Thanks again, Step. Read it again. </p>
<p>I love the way this classic American liberal develops his case in a measured, careful way, taking us with him as he defines &#8220;pre-emptive&#8221; and &#8220;preventive,&#8221; pausing on the way to rebuke Condoleeza Rice for her misunderstanding of Daniel Webster&#8217;s statement, and applying the terms he has defined to Iraq and America&#8217;s role in the modern world. And then the end, the quote from John Quincy Adams that America might become the &#8220;dictatress&#8221; of the world, and the last line, &#8220;That is the significance, for America and the world, of the American presidential election.&#8221;</p>
<p>His essay, I see, was written for the English readership of the Guardian. No Bushite could come close to this clear, beautiful essay that expresses in its very style the best of America. Compared to it, the Bushite thinking is ugly and overbearing. American liberals can speak abroad and be respected; the right wingers, no.<br />I&#8217;ve experienced proof of it tima and again as a Canadian. Richard Perle, for example, was broadcast a while ago in Canada, and his sulkiness and petulance were astoundingly ugly. The open expression of contempt may be admired in the US, but I doubt if us foreigners will accept it gladly.</p>
<p>I note with amusement how Perle is personally making out so well with US defence with the sale of a digital security company called Digital Net to a British company. He got a $2.5 million payment (for brokering deals, I think) that shareholders were so upset about that his cronies paid him. The Bushies may not have any lasting ideas about foreign or defence policy, and they certainly can&#8217;t express them, but I am sure they know how to line their pockets.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve noticed the same thing.  When I was younger I used to hear such clear and interesting conservative arguments.  There was a lot of reason and common sense built in.  Now, geez, the really good conservatives seemed to be drowned out by all this fear mongering.</p>
<p>I literally cannot remember the last time I heard a conservative argument that did not basically boil down to: &#8220;Let me sell you this fear.&#8221;  I&#8217;m not afraid of terrorists, I&#8217;m not afraid of the poor getting too much government money or of corporate America being crushed under the boot of a socialist liberal government.  </p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t buy those fears and you want some more substantial arguments, there&#8217;s nothing out there.  It&#8217;s kind of sad.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why many old-line conservatives (like me) are abandoning the neoconish/Bushist party in favor of anybody with a modicum of common sense, civic responsibility and vision.  The MBA<br />
 short-term, case-study bottom line mentality I saw in B-school is corrupting the party as it has business.</p>

<p>Don:</p>
<p>There are certain character strings which Dan&#8217;s site automatically rejects. It tells you what the questionable string (content) is when it rejects your posting. </p>
<p>You will have to try various alterations until you get through the auto-censor.</p>
<p>For example, do not insert the 3 char intials for this country: u-s-a</p>

<p>Bob M., craig,</p>
<p>This is what, oddly enough, cheers me when I listen to modern right-wingers: They are out of both reasons and reason. If they don&#8217;t (or haven&#8217;t) screw things up beyond repair, they&#8217;re toast, and the misery of getting to the toasting point was maybe worth it, for the people who didn&#8217;t die already. (It amazes me that I still tear up when I hear or read pieces on young dead soldiers, but I do.)</p>

<p>Thanks &#8220;step back&#8221;,</p>
<p>The rejection message did in fact show three letters following a colon. I changed a word containing those three letters to &#8220;charges&#8221; and it posted OK on the next thread, where it is more appropriate. The three letters were u-s-a and the original  word was &#8220;acc&#8212;sations.&#8221; It does seem odd to reject that word. I appreciated the information.</p>

<p>I keep hoping that G__gle starts listing anonymous FTP urls (which are perhaps more expensive to spider, but now they&#8217;ve got their market credit approved), .txt files, and directory listings.</p>
<p>Perhaps G__gle needs a preference checkbox for each of those things, or would one for all three be better?</p>

<p>The funny quotes, to me, and the most<br />brain-dead, are the ones that say search<br />will just become a marketing war.</p>
<p>Sorry. Wrong.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a technical war. And G&#8211;gle (sorry,<br />I had to change that because the post was<br />refused for &#8220;questionable content&#8221; because<br />it contained the non&#8212; form) is<br />way ahead. Their server farm, algorithms,<br />and implementation are not within reach<br />of Microsoft unless the MS culture has<br />a serious re-adjustment. Think bloat<br />and kitchen-sink versus lean and mean.</p>

<p>Stan &#8211; I wish it were so, but when MS integrates search with the OS in a smarter way it won&#8217;t have to be *better*. Outlook and Outlook Express aren&#8217;t better, they&#8217;re just the most accessible. In the beginning, IE wasn&#8217;t better &#8211; in fact it was significantly worse &#8211; but it took over because it was ubiquitous and eventually got &#8220;better.&#8221;</p>
<p>As always: IMHO.</p>

<p></span>
<p>A few things to consider:</p>
<p>1.  The &#8220;desktop search&#8221; gap exists on the already released Microsoft OSes.  If and when Microsoft releases a new OS with a decent desktop search, it will be limited to new installs.</p>
<p>2.  Goo-gle (and others) are shipping a &#8220;good enough&#8221; free desktop search today, available for win2k and xp.  The niche is open today, and will be filled before (if) Microsoft ships a WinFS-based OS.</p>
<p>3.  The tie-in between desktop search and web search is unproven.  &#8220;Switching&#8221; web search providers is so trivial that comparisons with the browser wars don&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>4.  Microsoft needs new features to get people to upgrade to the new OS, so they won&#8217;t ship a win2k/xp installable desktop search capability.  This is a strategic error, because it takes Microsoft out of the game until the next OS release (2006?).  There&#8217;s some speculation that they acquired Lookoutsoft just to get it off the market.</p>

<p>Hi Doug</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right about the power of MS to win<br />markets due to their broad distribution<br />powers.</p>
<p>In the search battle, though, they&#8217;ve got<br />a number of hills to climb.</p>
<p>[1] Google&#8217;s first-mover advantage. Nobody else<br />is near them in terms of search excellence at<br />this point. We who search, and advise others on<br />learning how to search, are going to need a lot<br />of motivation to shift and advise others to shift.</p>
<p>[2] The clean/minimalist design of Googleware<br />versus MS tendencies towards kitchen-sinkish<br />bloat. MS has to perform a tough coding cultural<br />shift. Non-<br />
trivial.</p>
<p>[3] The toughness of the problem. Search can look<br />easy to smart nerdals until they start diving into<br />it seriously. Easy to be over-confident about things before the doing gets done.</p>

<p>Once again, the righties can&#8217;t comprehend the simple concept of Dan linking to something being different than Dan taking the position of that link.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a link to a site that is open to ANYONE &#8212; liberal, conservative, whatever &#8212; who wants to submit an ad. If someone posted an ad comparing Kerry to Castro, would you be offended? Would you then accuse Dan of being a right-wing nutcase? Somehow I doubt it.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t understand why it&#8217;s illegal to do a comparison against certain people.  I&#8217;m not stating that a comparison between Bush and Hitler is an apt (or particularly imaginative) one.  But you should be able to compare anybody to anybody else- the real question is if the comparison fits, and how well.  Compare Kerry to Stalin?  Go ahead.  Compare Bush to Mother Theresa?   As Bush would say, bring it on!  I can judge for myself whether that comparison makes sense.  </p>
<p>Sure, comparing anybody to Hitler is a pretty easy way to say that person is evil/threat to society/insert monstrous character flaw here.  Is anyone really going to be taken in by such an argument?  I just recognize it for what it is- a shot that is so overdone it can&#8217;t even be called cheap anymore.  It&#8217;s just another form of Godwin&#8217;s law &#8211; &#8220;As the number of grass roots political documentaries grows larger, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is shocking that there are no Bush or Nader ads there!</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t see any real substantial value out of this, even if it were to become fully loaded with commercials from all candidates and parties, after all, this is polictal advertising. This is video-political fetishism.</p>
<p>It was disappointing not to be able to find the one with Hitler&#8211;according to those in the know it&#8217;s really cool but it doesn&#8217;t seem to exist anymore. Anybody got a link to it? Or is it just one of those crazy internet rumors?</p>

<p>Does anyone else find it disturbing when news organizations endorse a candidate?  A news organization is supposed to report the facts and give a balanced set of editorial commentary.  To achieve this, they need to maintain both objectivity and the perception of objectivity:  otherwise either the news will be biased (case 1) or the public will lose faith in it (case 2), at which point it ceases to serve the public.</p>
<p>When a news organization endorses a candidate or party, they give up all claim to objectivity.  This hurts both the press and the public.  Individual writers are supposed to state their opinions, but the organization as a whole should represent the reality, eschewing personal bias.</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t agree with the title of <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/roberts10152004.html">this essay</a> by Paul Craig Roberts, a conservative writer and commentator. But his points are important. Sample:<br />
<blockquote><i>Bush&#8217;s conservative supporters  want no debate. They want no facts, no analysis. They want to denounce and to demonize the enemies that the Hannitys, Limbaughs, and Savages of talk radio assure them are everywhere at work destroying their great and noble country.</p>
<p>I remember when conservatives favored restraint in foreign policy and wished to limit government power in order to protect civil liberties. Today&#8217;s young conservatives are Jacobins determined to use government power to impose their  will at home and abroad.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll tell you after the election is over, with Bush trouncing Kerry.</p>
<p>It will, indeed, strike fear into the heart of the naive, weak-minded extremist Left, when the American people give Bush a stunning mandate.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll point fingers, first over THERE, then (turning) over THERE and, finally (turning to John Kerry) exactly where the blame belongs.</p>
<p>Hate Bush will become hate Kerry.</p>

<p>Ha, the Bushies can&#8217;t even impose their will a mile north of the border. They may fly in Texas but they&#8217;re a joke in Canada and the rest of the world.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think that many of Bush&#8217;s supporters really care about Iraq or budget deficits. I think the &#8220;culture war&#8221; meme is really his strength; there&#8217;s a strong belief throughout portions of America that the liberals oppose God, via religion-free schools and courtrooms and via breaking down traditions of all kinds, including gender roles, marriage and family stability, sexual exclusivity. To be sure, there isn&#8217;t really a groundswell to roll back easier divorce laws, but handing out condoms in schools is seen by conservatives as an endorsement of premarital sex, and abortion a reward for wicked behavior.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying any of this is correct, but I think the many people who believe in the culture war concept feel obligated to support the Republican candidate, regardless of whether he knows how to conduct a war or not.</p>

<p>Today, the New York Times Magazine ran a very long, but very important an powerful piece that outlines Bush&#8217;s faith and instincts-based presidency, the thinking Bush used in leading our country to war with Iraq, and what he has planned for Â‘whenÂ’ he is reelected for a second term. (very scary)</p>
<p>The TV media MUST pick up and cover this story! </p>
<p>Without a Doubt<br />By Ron Suskind, New York Times<br />October 17, 2004<br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/17BUSH.html?oref=login&#038;oref=login&#038;oref=login&#038;pagewanted=all&#038;position">http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/17BUSH.html?oref=login&#038;oref=login&#038;oref=login&#038;pagewanted=all&#038;position</a> (you may need to register for a username, but THIS IS AN IMPORTANT READ)</p>
<p>Excerpts:<br />*&#8221;Just in the past few months,&#8221; Bartlett said, &#8221;I think a light has gone off for people who&#8217;ve spent time up close to Bush: that this instinct he&#8217;s always talking about is this sort of weird, Messianic idea of what he thinks God has told him to do.&#8221; Bartlett, a 53-year-old columnist and self-described libertarian Republican who has lately been a champion for traditional Republicans concerned about Bush&#8217;s governance, went on to say: &#8221;This is why George W. Bush is so clear-eyed about Al Qaeda and the Islamic fundamentalist enemy. He believes you have to kill them all. They can&#8217;t be persuaded, that they&#8217;re extremists, driven by a dark vision. He understands them, because he&#8217;s just like them&#8230; </p>
<p>*&#8221;This is why he dispenses with people who confront him with inconvenient facts,&#8221; Bartlett went on to say. &#8221;He truly believes he&#8217;s on a mission from God. Absolute faith like that overwhelms a need for analysis. The whole thing about faith is to believe things for which there is no empirical evidence.&#8221; Bartlett paused, then said, &#8221;But you can&#8217;t run the world on faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>*All of this &#8212; the &#8221;gut&#8221; and &#8221;instincts,&#8221; the certainty and religiosity -connects to a single word, &#8221;faith,&#8221; and faith asserts its hold ever more on debates in this country and abroad. That a deep Christian faith illuminated the personal journey of George W. Bush is common knowledge. But faith has also shaped his presidency in profound, nonreligious ways. The president has demanded unquestioning faith from his followers, his staff, his senior aides and his kindred in the Republican Party. Once he makes a decision &#8212; often swiftly, based on a creed or moral position &#8212; he expects complete faith in its rightness.</p>
<p>*This is one key feature of the faith-based presidency: open dialogue, based on facts, is not seen as something of inherent value. It may, in fact, create doubt, which undercuts faith. It could result in a loss of confidence in the decision-maker and, just as important, by the decision-maker. Nothing could be more vital, whether staying on message with the voters or the terrorists or a California congressman in a meeting about one of the world&#8217;s most nagging problems. As Bush himself has said any number of times on the campaign trail, &#8221;By remaining resolute and firm and strong, this world will be peaceful.&#8221;</p>
<p>*Forty democratic senators were gathered for a lunch in March just off the Senate floor. I was there as a guest speaker. Joe Biden was telling a story, a story about the president. &#8221;I was in the Oval Office a few months after we swept into Baghdad,&#8221; he began, &#8221;and I was telling the president of my many concerns&#8221; &#8212; concerns about growing problems winning the peace, the explosive mix of Shiite and Sunni, the disbanding of the Iraqi Army and problems securing the oil fields. Bush, Biden recalled, just looked at him, unflappably sure that the United States was on the right course and that all was well. &#8221;&#8217;Mr. President,&#8217; I finally said, &#8216;How can you be so sure when you know you do<br />
n&#8217;t know the facts?&#8221;&#8217; </p>
<p>Biden said that Bush stood up and put his hand on the senator&#8217;s shoulder. &#8221;My instincts,&#8221; he said. &#8221;My instincts.&#8221; </p>
<p>Biden paused and shook his head, recalling it all as the room grew quiet. &#8221;I said, &#8216;Mr. President, your instincts aren&#8217;t good enough!&#8221;&#8217;</p>

				<blockquote><li>Washington Post (reg req): <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A36853-2004Oct15.html">Bahamas Firm Screens Personal Data To Assess Risk</a>. <i>It began as one of the Bush administration&#8217;s most ambitious homeland security efforts, a passenger screening program designed to use commercial records, terrorist watch lists and computer software to assess millions of travelers and target those who might pose a threat. The system has cost almost $100 million. But it has not been turned on because it sparked protests from lawmakers and civil liberties advocates, who said it intruded too deeply into the lives of ordinary Americans. The Bush administration put off testing until after the election. Now the choreographer of that program, a former intelligence official named Ben H. Bell III, is taking his ideas to a private company offshore, where he and his colleagues plan to use some of the same concepts, technology and contractors to assess people for risk, outside the reach of U.S. regulators, according to documents and interviews. </i> </p></blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just about assessing risk. It&#8217;s also about making our most personal information available to anyone who wants to see it &#8212; and contorting the law in the process.
<p>Getting personal data from quasi-private contractors has been a tactic of choice for the Bush administration and other privacy invaders lately. The fairly weak privacy legislation we now have, dating back several decades, has given rise to this end run on the law. This scheme takes the technique to an entirely new level.</p>
<p>Are you willing to see what&#8217;s left of your privacy shredded by government control freaks &#8212; who will be joined by corporate purchasers, local authorities and, eventually, anyone with requisite cash? This will be big business, after all.</p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t outraged by what&#8217;s going on here, you are a lamb heading to the slaughter.</p>

<p>So, electing John Kerry will mean that folks like Ben H. Bell III will be barred forever from<br />leaving government service to apply information technology expertise in the private sector?  Or<br />will their passports will be taken away as a condition of government service?</p>
<p>Dan is outraged because a private citizen leaves government service?</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stop the revolving door&#8221; said Bill Clinton in 1992 (who also said elect me and &#8220;you&#8217;ll<br />get the most ethical Administration in American history&#8221;).</p>
<p>It never really works out that way, because (i) Democrat demagoguery and socialist wage leveling<br />for unionized government officials has prevented for generations the development of a civil<br />service compensated at fair market value, and (ii) it&#8217;s all lies from the Left anyway &#8212; they<br />have no intention of &#8220;reforming&#8221; the revolving door, they *REVEL* in it.</p>
<p>Propose sweeping reforms of civil service regulations &#8212; eliminating most of the hard union<br />Left concessions that make wages level and firing/discipline non-existent &#8212; offer to make<br />government service a career alternative to the private sector, and maybe we can talk.</p>
<p>The Democrats will never do this because they are heavily funded by big Labor, and government<br />unions are the only growth sector for their economic interference and corruption.</p>
<p>(Except maybe the hotel sector in San Francisco, where the unions are disrupting the daily<br />lives of everyone without reasonable restraints).</p>

<p>George, I don&#8217;t have any great comfort that Kerry would be significantly better, though he&#8217;s said he&#8217;d try to roll back pieces of the &#8220;Patriot&#8221; Act (which he voted for).</p>
<p>I was tough on Clinton&#8217;s administration for whacks at privacy and civil liberties, and I&#8217;d give Kerry no quarter on this, either. But Bush is in a league of his own. In my lifetime, there has been no government remotely as contemptuous of privacy and liberty as this one, and if he&#8217;s reelected he&#8217;s going to work to make it immeasurably more invasive. He&#8217;s made no secret of this; heck, he&#8217;s bragged about it.</p>

<p>Hi Dan. The URL is actually <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/blog.asp.">http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/blog.asp.</a> The one you are referring to leads to an HTTP 403 error.</p>

<p>Grrr. IE considers the &#8220;.&#8221; that terminates the sentence to be part of the URL in my previous post. So the correct URL should be: <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/blog.asp">http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/blog.asp</a> in the above post. Sorry for the double entry.</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t know whether a certain TV news host is guilty of sexual harassment or the target, as he responds to a lawsuit, of extortion. I do know I&#8217;m disturbed by the way our society tends to treat accusation as truth.</p>
<p>In criminal allegations, any prosecutor can get a grand jury to issue an indictment. But indictment isn&#8217;t proof. <br />Yet the &#8220;perp walk&#8221; &#8212; the public arresting of suspects followed by press conferences in which officials pronounce guilt before a trial &#8212; is designed to make the person guilty in the public eye, and it usually works. There are too many cases where people have been railroaded, or where police and prosecutors wrongly settled on their targets to the exclusion of investigating alternatives, for us to assume anything but the constitutional presumption of innocence.</p>
<p>Civil cases are even worse. Anybody can file a lawsuit, and wealthy people seem to get hit with this stuff more than other people. We all know why; where there&#8217;s money to be made, some people will take big risks to get it. Even when cases are thrown out for a total lack of evidence, judges rarely enforce the laws against frivolous lawsuits.</p>
<p>The media have some responsibility here. We demonstrate it too rarely. Anything is fair game once legal papers hit the courthouse. One reason is that quoting public documents offers immunity in libel suits. Yet I believe we lose some of our own credibility in this process, especially when we don&#8217;t emphasize &#8212; and I mean really shout it out &#8212; that the accusation is just an accusation, not the remotest proof of anything.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no fan of the TV host in question. But barring persuasive evidence from his accuser, I&#8217;m going to assume he&#8217;s the target of something other than a legitimate complaint. And I&#8217;m going to keep his image in my mind the way it was before these accusations hit the media. You should, too.</p>

<p>But in this case the coverage (lead by Drudge of course) started with an O&#8217;Reilly attack where he accused Andrea Mackris of extortion.  So who is the accuser here?  Whose guilt has already been decided?  </p>

<p>Senator John F. Kerry made one, and I mean *just* one, public commitment to give a hard news interview prior to the election.  </p>
<p>Bill O&#8217;Reilly.</p>
<p>This &#8220;case&#8221; has given him an &#8220;sexual harasser&#8221; out, and I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll take it.</p>

<p>I agree the news media give too much emphasis to this sort of stuff. But why does it follow that the lawsuit is presumptively &#8220;something other than a legitimate complaint&#8221;? And as Mr Tippett points out, do you extend the same presumption to O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s lawsuit?</p>

<p>The Left tore up its credentials on sexual harrassment in the 1990s for naked expediency.  Does Dan actually think we&#8217;re so blind and foolish to forget?</p>
<p>But did Dan stand &#8220;neutral&#8221;, and extend equal &#8220;presumptions&#8221; to accuser and alleged culprit, when Juanita Broderick accused President Clinton of rape?</p>
<p>Did Dan side with Paula Jones while she argued all the way to the Supreme Court for the right to have her sexual harassment case against Bill Clinton heard during his Administration?  (She won that point before the Supreme Court, which ruled that Executive Privilege did not shield Clinton).</p>
<p>Did Dan critique Clinton for &#8212; as is now well documented &#8212; directing surrogates to attack Monica Lewinsky as a disgruntled, &#8220;mentally unstable stalker&#8221; for 10 days after &#8220;I did not have sex with *that woman*&#8221;, before he did a 180 and confessed to his inner circle?</p>
<p>Now that it&#8217;s a case against Bill O&#8217;Reilly, Dan wants to be balanced.  Sheesh!</p>
<p>Sorry, Dan, you gave up any semblance of balance on this issue long ago, and any claim to *genuine* overriding concern for the interests of alleged women victims.  </p>
<p>You have been willing to put the political needs of the day ahead of the rights of women proclaiming sexual abuse, harassment and even rape, when the Left was the target.  Your motives for inserting your opinion in this case are suspect.</p>

<p>Whether Bill O&#8217;Reilly is guilty of anything or not, I have great sympathy for him since he has now entered the legal Twilight Zone of &#8220;sexual harassment&#8221; proceedings.  In a rare moment of agreement between Mr. Gilmor and myself, I am also upset at the &#8220;accused = guilty&#8221; reasoning in all too many cases.</p>
<p>But sexual harassment is holy war of the left, for which justice has no bearing on attaining the ends: guilt.  Like McCarthyism in the 1950&#8217;s or the Salem Witch hunts of old, the mere allegation of sexual harassment is &#8220;evidence&#8221; enought to sustain his guilt.  Period.  I work for a VERY large company and it&#8217;s been made clear &#8212; both in policy and in firings &#8212; that the mere allegation is sufficient to justify termination.  Nowadays, &#8220;sexual harassment&#8221; can mean almost anything and only needs to be &#8220;perceived&#8221; by the &#8220;victim&#8221; in order to have taken place.  Several men have been lost all &#8212; job, house, career, everything &#8212; and been left standing asking, &#8220;What did I do wrong?&#8221;  The answer is befuddling: &#8220;It&#8217;s not what you did<br />
, it&#8217;s how it was how she, uh, &#8216;perceived&#8217; it.&#8221;  So there you go; if she *felt* or *perceived* it as harassment &#8212; regardless of whether it was &#8212; then it&#8217;s treated just the same as if he groped her in the hall.</p>
<p>This points to another dynamic in the &#8220;accused = guilty&#8221; reasoning in these cases: there are no gradations of severity of guilt.  Whether he &#8220;looked at her in a &#8216;weird&#8217; way&#8221; or whether he outright groped her in front of colleagues, a man merely accused of sexual harassment is met with the maximum punishment &#8212; of course after an absurd &#8220;investigation&#8221; to &#8220;prove&#8221; the foregone conclusion of his guilt.</p>
<p>Many people rightly decry the seeming injustice of Ashcroft&#8217;s kangaroo courts for &#8220;terrorists&#8221; (wherein the standard of evidence is nill, the proceedings are kept a dirty secret, the prosecution runs the show, and the conclusion is pre-determined).  But understand that men &#8212; especially white men &#8212; have lived under a &#8220;accused = guilty&#8221; system since the circus of the Anita Hill hearings.</p>
<p>Like many guys living under the fear of mere allegation, I feel for Mr. O&#8217;Reilly.  Whether guilty or not, I sympathize with him insofar as I can&#8217;t stand to see anyone put through McCarthy-style injustice.</p>

<p>I would argue that Dan is being a bit generous in labeling the accused harasser in this case as a Â“news hostÂ”.  But I do agree completely with DanÂ’s sentiments.</p>
<p>I was accused of sexual harassment a few years ago. The charges were completely bogus, but very similar to those in this case.   In my situation, only a few co-workers knew about the allegations, so I didnÂ’t have to endure much of the negative publicity and opinion ramifications Dan mentions.  But the frustration and anger I felt that something like this could even happen, and the fear of an unknown outcome were damaging enough.</p>
<p>Fortunately, things were resolved in my favor in a matter of days, and the accuser was fired.  But the stress was unbearable, and the situation contributed significantly to the end of  my marriage. Try explaining to your wife why you need to take a few weeks off from work while you are being investigated for sexual harassmentÂ….</p>
<p>I could have (and probably should have) filed suit against my accuser and her lawyer.  I chose not to.  But I most definitely learned the moral significance of assuming innocence, and waiting to pass judgment until the facts come out in a court of law.  </p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t this the same O&#8217;Reilly who admitted that Fox&#8217;s lawsuit against Al Franken was frivolous? Hoist, petard, etc.</p>
<p>While I agree that the allegations are not proven and need to be treated as such&#8211;this is not a Senate hearing or a criminal trial, folks. It&#8217;s a lawsuit.</p>

				<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>As anyone who reads the comments on this site knows, we are burdened with a persistent troll. This person takes reflexively ultra-right positions on just about everything and salts his comments with personal attacks on anyone who has a different view of the world. </p>
<p>Some of the responses have descended into name-calling, too, as he correctly notes in his otherwise predictably unpleasant way below. The fact that people feel so provoked by his ravings does not excuse this kind of language in the responses.</p>
<p>The larger problem is that you only encourage him when you respond. This gives him more ability to disrupt the site than if he&#8217;s just left alone to stew in his strange juices. </p>
<p>So once again: Please don&#8217;t feed the troll.</p>

<p>When all is said and done, the trolls are most dangerous to their own prejudices and philosophies.  They discredit themselves and their positions without yielding anything of substance&#8230;a verbal fart, if you will.</p>
<p>My father taught me it was unfair to engage in a battle of wits with an unarmed opponent, and I should be ashamed to score points at their expense.  Okay, I understand that, and the logic for not feeding the trolls.   but, Lord, it is SO-O-O tempting to provoke them when they are so sure of themselves AND unpleasant to boot.</p>

<p>I was surprised when my significant other (a female) starting leaning towards Bush after #3. Before that, she was leaning towards Kerry.</p>
<p>What did he do, how did he (Karl Rove) do it?</p>
<p>It went right over my testerone-drugged head. I thought Kerry was so much more &#8220;Presidential&#8221;. In my opinion, a mind is a terrible thing not to have in the White House. Was it the draft? Was it the &#8220;tax relief&#8221; line?</p>

<p>Kerry was revealed to the American people as the &#8220;conservative senator from the State of Massachussetts&#8221;.</p>
<p>He gay-baited his opponents, outing Dick Cheney&#8217;s daughter on national television to an audience of tens of millions of people, appealing to the prejudices of extreme right evangelicals in the most vile and despicable manner possible.</p>
<p>He played pander bear, promising that big government will cure all ills.  &#8220;Got a problem?  I got a pogam fo it!&#8221;  </p>
<p>The extreme gap between his promises and his tax plan &#8212; so far Left no Congress, not even a majority Democrat Congress, would go for it &#8212; was laid plain.  The feeble counterattack, characterizing the President&#8217;s plan to let Americans keep ownership of a portion of their social security contributions as &#8220;new spending&#8221;, was eviscerated by Bush&#8217;s pointing out the cost of inaction is GREATER.</p>
<p>Kerry&#8217;s rhetoric on immigration &#8220;earned legalization&#8221; fell on deaf ears, as he was revealed as supporting another amnesty.  His suggestion that retinal scans (!) were the key to the problem of illegal immigration from the South was worse than pathetic.  He seemed way out of his depths there.</p>
<p>He couldn&#8217;t avoid mentioning Iraq, opening himself up to the plethora of horrors facing Kerry on the foreign policy front, with his characterization of terrorism as a &#8220;nuisance like prostitution&#8221;, his Global Test, his berating and belittling of allies.  All his worst one-liner slipups, came back to bite him in the behind.</p>
<p>His demonstrated a failure to comprehend the impact of the dot bom bubble, and the detonation of a tactical nuclear warhead-size weapon in the center of the U.S. financial districct, as contributing to the loss of jobs, and he failed to commend the President for the rapid pace of recent job creation, the pace of economic growth, the significant recent accumulation of unexpected tax revenues bringing down the deficit, and the host of additional Bush<br />
accomplishments &#8212; a dramatic aversion of a threatened depression, and a strong recovery now that the tax cuts are in place, which no Kerry Administration could possibly hope to keep going apace.</p>
<p>And, of course, the American people saw the Kerry vision of bigger government, oppressive high taxes on small businesses, an aversion to real reforms of social security and medicare &#8212; all sorts of disappointing policy positions worthy of the 1970s, not the 21st Century.</p>
<p>Kerry was also revealed as a pro-abortion absolutist, who opposes restricting partial birth abortion, and intends to apply a strict litmus test for government.  This reinforced the view he propogated at the last debate, where he criticized Bush for characterizing Thomas and Scalia as his favorite justices.  (Of course, this is an extraordinary flip/flop for Kerry, who voted for Scalia&#8217;s confirmation to shore up support in the Italian-American community before a tight re-election contest).</p>
<p>The list goes on and on.  A complete government takeover of health insurance with a &#8220;single re-insurer&#8221; plan for catastrophic coverage.  Kerry compared Bush to Tony Soprano, then himself said that &#8220;you can take my plan, or you can keep yours with your high premiums, your shrinking coverage&#8221;.   One of the audience members of the live-blog in which I participated last night said, Kerry&#8217;s plan is &#8220;the offer you can&#8217;t refuse!&#8221;  ROFL everywhere.</p>
<p>Kerry offered Karl Rove a full panoply for a full scale counterassault for the rest of the month.  Kerry is toast.</p>

<p>Hey, pb, you must be Canadian. </p>
<p>In Canada, for those of you who don&#8217;t know us, the rule is, The exception is the rule. Americans get the point of a pattern, and it becomes a rule. It&#8217;s a rule of thumb, right? In Canada, however, whenever you point out a pattern, someone points out an exception. So there&#8217;s a real lack of common ground on what is a good rule of thumb on anything you can think of. Try it on the next Canadian you meet if you don&#8217;t believe me.</p>

<p>Query is burning more energy than everyone else.</p>
<p>Let him (her?) keep going. Just keeps building a longer list of mis-truths.</p>
<p>Query: Even the Higher Son got that first &#8220;talking point&#8221; more correct than you did. Karl Rove told him (via the back bulge?) to label *Ted Kennedy* as the conservative L-word from Mass. The point was to place Kind Kerry even more to the Left (on the outer bank). You were supposed to have understood that. Didn&#8217;t your Puppet-of-the-Neocons Talking-Points pamphlet arrive this week? This week&#8217;s sound bark is the &#8220;L&#8221; sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;He gay-baited his opponents, outing Dick Cheney&#8217;s daughter on national television to an audience of tens of millions of people, appealing to the prejudices of extreme right evangelicals in the most vile and despicable manner possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outed Dick Cheney&#8217;s daughter?  Hardly.  This wasn&#8217;t a secret or anything.  It has been reported that Mary Cheney &#8220;publically &#8216;declared&#8217; herself a lesbian, and has worked as the gay and lesbian corporate relations manager for Coors Brewing Co.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prior to this, Alan Keyes also called Mary a &#8220;selfish hedonist&#8221; because or lesbianism.<br /><a href="http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20040901-093347-1067r.

<p>Dick Cheney&#8217;s daughter has discussed her sexual preference privately, never &#8212; EVER &#8212; on the record.</p>
<p>It is indisputable, and the Kerry team&#8217;s internals show it, that most of Bush&#8217;s evangelicals supporters did not know this.</p>
<p>Kerry outed her in from of 50 million Americans.</p>

<p>James Dalton Bell put together an idea for a distributed system of political control called &#8216; assassination politics&#8217;. It was such a good idea that, like Inslaw&#8217;s PROMIS software it was stolen by the government. ( renamed PAM )<br />We know just a handful of hateful individuals are guilty of much of the spamming and virus propagation we all have to endure and as trolling fits that profile and Jim Bell suggested his system might be used to control car thieves one day, I would like to suggest the modified use of this net based P2P anarchistic system in this case.</p>

<p>I like many posts Dan makes but why do so many liberals try to squelch speech that disagrees with their point of view, often attempting to demonize those with alternate points of view.  I thought liberalism was about openness and hearing all points of view (indeed, even relativism)?  That&#8217;s one of the things I like about what liberalism is supposed to be.</p>
<p>But it seems like we&#8217;ve let emotion get the better of us and have gotten personal with this stuff.  So what if query posts opposing ideas &#8211; skip the post for godsakes people if it bothers you that much.  How are you any better than some supposed troll if you have to get down and sling mud and insults, etc.</p>
<p>Anyway, can&#8217;t we all get along?  ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>I wish Dan would make this blog more about technology and less about politics.  As it has become more and more political, I&#8217;ve read it less and less.</p>

<p>If you didn&#8217;t know Cheney&#8217;s daughter was gay, you live under a rock.  And her sexuality was also covered in the VP debates, so to say Kerry outed her is just silly.  </p>

<p>BlogGirl &#8211;You hit the nail right on the head. Yes you are correct. </p>
<p>There are 3 levels of conversation. </p>
<p>Karl Rove (RNC psych ops master) knows it all too well. Two of the conversations are with the more primitive, limbic and reptilian parts of the human brain while only one is with the higher-thinking, cortical part. The &#8220;mixed messages&#8221; get through to all 3. </p>
<p>For many Americans, the final vote is decided by the lower 2. But we do not phrase it that way. Instead, we say &#8220;I have a gut feeling that I like _____ better&#8221; (pick Kerry/Edwards or Cheney/Bush) as we pull that voting lever.</p>
<p>If you cannot articulate the reason, then you are probably voting with your limbic and/or reptilian brains.</p>
<p>The reptilian brain reacts to fear &#038; hate.<br />The limbic brain reacts to love &#038; loyalty.</p>
<p>That is why the Cheney/Bush team has wrapped themselves in the American flag and proclaimed war against &#8220;those who hate our freedom&#8221; and security for the children of all soccer moms.</p>
<p>Now on the issue of Loving Lynn and her Left-behind Lesbian daughter &#8211;I was listening to a radio talk show this morning and all the pro-Republicans were calling in with rage and rag in their arguments. They were angry for having been &#8220;outed&#8221; &#8211;as Hypocrites.</p>
<p>How can those who &#8220;Love Life&#8221; and who &#8220;Leave no child behind&#8221; not agree that the Vice Pesidential daughter has a right to &#8220;be who she is&#8221;.</p>
<p>Kerry kicked them where it hurts with that one. It was slightly below the belt &#8211;yes&#8211; but I&#8217;m sure they understand because they are such &#8220;compassionate&#8221; people. </p>
<p>Karl Rove wanted the &#8220;L&#8221;-word to be a code for &#8220;Liberal&#8221;. But as seen on NBC&#8217;s Today Show this morning, the Democrats have re-directed that arrow to mean Lesbian rights. The Republicans have been temporarily beat at their own game.</p>

<p>Instead of talking about taking daughter Cheney&#8217;s name in vain, let&#8217;s get back to the BIG issues, the real issues:</p>
<p>1) How are we going to get out of the mess in Iraq?<br />2) How are we going to kick start our faltering economy?<br />3) How are we going to fix our collapsing school systems?<br />4) How are we going to combat eco-destruction and global warming?</p>

<p>(The irony is that Cheney&#8217;s daughter *has* publicly discussed her sexual orientation, and has even used it to campaign for Cheney. Lynn Cheney and Dick Cheney have both discussed it in campaign speeches. The right&#8217;s whining on this issue simply has no basis in reality.)</p>

<p>What seperates a troll from legimate discussion? That is the true question on this topic.</p>
<p>For me a troll is a poster of any opinion that is over the top in their posting. Constant ad hominem attacks, disrespect for other&#8217;s opinions and general over-the-top behavior characteristize a troll. No change of opinion or politenes occurs. Confrontation is the only goal. I apply the Daffy Duck rule: if you can picture Daffy Duck jumping up and down yelling quoting the message while you remain calm, it&#8217;s probably a troll. </p>
<p>What I don&#8217;t understand about trolls is their seeming compulsive need to be heard. After a while I tend to avoid places I am not welcome, but trolls seem to enjoy it.</p>
<p>step back: I am not sure I reach your third level often, but I am aware of the issues you mention and the distractions you cite. That really concerns me and quite frankly, scare me.</p>

<p>A Z: There is another issue going on at this &#8220;Don&#8217;t Feed the Troll&#8221; site.</p>
<p>Suppose I tell you that this has been an experiment by a psychology class.</p>
<p>We want to see how an ostracizing LABEL affects free speech.</p>
<p>Instead of labeling someone as a &#8220;liberal&#8221; or as a &#8220;neocon&#8221;, we use the &#8220;troll&#8221; label.</p>
<p>A certain percentage of the public is composed of ostracism-phobic personalty type. They are horrified by the idea of being identified as a &#8220;troll&#8221; and of thereby being shunned by the community. So they will instantly cease particiapation for fear of being labeled a &#8220;troll&#8221;. That is one bullying tactic. Create a repugnant label, attach it to one member of the community (Yes you query, even though you&#8217;re probably not a troll and you don&#8217;t hide under the bridge teasing the toads), and make an example of that one, picked out individual.</p>
<p>Luckily query has guts. He was not fully intimidated by the &#8220;troll&#8221; label.</p>
<p>So next bullyng tactic, is a sign on the lawn: Don&#8217;t Feed the Trolls. Now anyone in the group who talks to the to-be-shunned member is himself a no-good troll-feeder who is to be harranged.</p>
<p>Did this bullying tactic squelch free speech?</p>
<p>I think the answer is yes. At least here.</p>
</p>
<p>P.S. In the fairy tale, The Three Billy Goats Gruff, the third and biggest goat comes off the mountain and boots the troll off the bridge. The smaller goats live happily ever after.</p>
<p>PPS Blog trolling is a real problem. There are technical solutions. It has to do with how much energy readers have to expend to circumvent a posting that they deem as &#8220;troll-some&#8221; and move on to the next.</p>

<p>I agree with query.  It was *horrible* of Kerry to try to use the evangelical right&#8217;s hatred of homosexuality for political gain.  </p>
<p>Good thing our President would NEVER do anything like that!  </p>
<p>The next thing you know, Kerry&#8217;ll be accusing the Administration of trying to pass pro-homo Constitutional Amendments,  just to rile up the right-thinking people on the right-most wing of the Republican party.</p>

<p>The man who voted &#8212; at the height of the Cold War &#8212; to cancel the B-1B, the B-2, the Apache, the Patriot Missile, SDI research, the Aegis Missile Defense System, and the &#8220;dangerously provocative&#8221; equipping of our troops with countermeasures for chemical and biological weaspons, CANNOT be criticized as a poor potential commander-in-chief!</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s just terrorism, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s just Bush. </p>
<p>The third-party folks would argue that there&#8217;s so little difference between the GOP and the Democrats that candidates *must* drive wedges between each other in order to seem different.</p>
<p>But I suspect it&#8217;s not that. It&#8217;s simply a matter of playing to your strong suit. Bush can&#8217;t point to the economy (he&#8217;s wrecked that). He can&#8217;t point to the war in Iraq (it&#8217;s going terribly). He can&#8217;t point to healthcare, or civil liberties, or a host of other things.</p>
<p>Bush&#8217;s big positive, such as it is, is that he was in charge on 9/11. He did well for a few weeks then, and he wants people to think of him as *that* Bush, not the one we&#8217;ve seen since.</p>
<p>Hence, &#8220;9/11, 9/11, 9/11!&#8221;</p>

<p>9/11 delivered the equivalent of a tactical nuclear warhead detonation in the heart of the NYC Financial District.  </p>
<p>Very little discussion of the economic impact has occurred, in part out of respect for the dead, and partly (unfortunately) out of a partisan creed that you can&#8217;t highlight facts favorable to Bush.</p>
<p>9/11 was the worst attack on our economy in the history of the United States of America.  We lost 1,000,000 jobs over the ensuing three months.  That on top of nearly equivalent job losses resulting directly from the dot com bubble which burst on the Clinton/Gore 9 months before Bush came into office.</p>
<p>Bush&#8217;s record of turning what could have been a decade long, catastrophic depression into the shortest recession in U.S. history is a harrowing achievement.  But it cannot be, and won&#8217;t be, discussed, just as Kerry&#8217;s true record of selling out the interests of the United States to a radical internationalist agenda can&#8217;t be discussed.</p>
<p>Hate Bush! </p>

<p>If someone could explain to me what the B-1B, the B-2, the Apache, the Patriot Missile, SDI research, the Aegis Missile Defense System have to do with stopping terrorists I&#8217;d be grateful. As far as I understand it, the B1-B is a billion dollar aircraft who job could be done a lot cheaper by firing missiles at the enemy from submarines, the Apache has been crap in the desert and keeps getting shot down, the Patriot missile system doesn&#8217;t work (during the Gulf war not one missile was shot down by the Patriot system, see union of concerned scientists for a report), SDI, well, less said the better as it doesn&#8217;t work after billions of dollars of investment, Aegis Missile Defense System may stand a chance of working but doesn&#8217;t really help against the real threat: terrorists. I think the President&#8217;s attitude towards terrorists can be summed up as believing states are the problem, while Kerry beleives (if I&#8217;ve understood correctly) that it is non-state actors such as Al Qaeda that are the main threat. In either case, its boots on the ground that matter, not billion dollar weapons systems that even Cheney wanted to cancel. If we had spent all this money on the troops, and on equipment the troops needed to secure Iraq after the invasion, we wouldn&#8217;t be in the mess we are today. </p>

<p>Query seems to be masturbating all over this blog, but I&#8217;m going to repost part of what I said on my blog:</p>
<p>The real hijackers of the American people are the neocons who saw (or created) an opportunity and grabbed it. They have managed to scare some ordinary, often decent, people into fearful animals who cry for blood and vengence. It saddens me to see my country transformed this way. If we don&#8217;t get back to our roots soon, I think the terrorists &#8211; intent on striking fear into our collective hearts &#8211; and the neocons &#8211; intent on destroying American democracy &#8211; will have won.</p>

<p>All these weapons systems were used to destroy Al Qaeda&#8217;s training camps in Afghanistan and Northern Iraq, and to destroy a number of sites that were thought to contain WMD related materials.  </p>
<p>(Clinton said he thought that his assault on Iraq *without* UN approval during his impeachment hearings in 1998 (with the same systems Kerry wanted to cancel) destroyed Saddam&#8217;s WMD.  Why does he get away with this claim, unchallenged by the mainstream media?  Or are you willing to concede that Bush&#8217;s aerial assault on Saddam in 2003 preceding the invasion may have destroyed the WMD?)</p>
<p>As his fellow Senate Democrat said, Kerry is not only one of the least accomplished, most liberal Senators in America, he would have reduced our offensive capability to spitballs.</p>

<p>Wow.  To Craig, the &#8220;real&#8221; hijackers were the so-called &#8220;neocons&#8221;, not the Al Qaeda terrorists who killed so many Americans on 9/11.</p>

<p>President Bush has used 9/11 as a political stratagem.  He has used the &#8220;War on Terror&#8221; to paint himself as a hawkish politician, and mentions 9/11 in every one of his speeches to rouse his Republican base.</p>

<p>Query said &#8220;All these weapons systems were used to destroy Al Qaeda&#8217;s training camps in Afghanistan and Northern Iraq, and to destroy a number of sites that were thought to contain WMD related materials.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which indicates he wasn&#8217;t following what I said  correctly (plus how can a non-exsistent weapon system such as SDI, be used in a real war. Bizarre). Read what I said above. The B1 and B2 were used on some missions, but Tomahawk cruise missiles could have (and on some occasions, actually did) done the job that these billion dollar planes did for a lot cheaper cost. In fact, 50-year-old B-52&#8217;s dropped more munition that the B1 and B2 bombers. Why do you need a billion dollar stealth aircraft for a country that had no effective (or in Afghanistan&#8217;s case, a non-existent) anti-aircraft system?</p>
<p>I can use a jewel encrusted fork to put food in my mouth, but a plain metal spoon would do the job just as well. On one mission that 32 Apache helicopters went out on, 27 of them were either seriously damaged or shot down from simple AK-47&#8217;s and RPG&#8217;s. A tank would have been more effective (or an A-10, which is cheaper, and just as accurate as a helicopter). My point is that these expensive dinosaurs are not the cheapest, most effective tools for winning this war, and in some cases, actually hinder them. THe US hasn&#8217;t the luxery of being able to spend a ton of money on crappy systems anymore. We need to spend our money on what works. Boots on the ground work better at stopping terrorists and winning wars than a billion dollar aircraft that becomes visible when it rains. I would have thought that you neocons wcould have worked this out now that you&#8217;ve screwed up the peace in Iraq.</p>

<p>&#8220;So says Dan Gillmor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, Dan was linking to, and quoting from, a column by someone else. But don&#8217;t let reality stand in your way&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very little discussion of the economic impact has occurred, in part out of respect for the dead, and partly (unfortunately) out of a partisan creed that you can&#8217;t highlight facts favorable to Bush.&#8221;</p>
<p>Um&#8230; I don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;ve been, but there&#8217;s been lots of discussion of the economic impact of 9/11. But the fact is that it pales in comparison to the impact of the failed economic and domestic policies of this administration. But you&#8217;d have to understand economics to know that, which you obviously don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;As his fellow Senate Democrat said, Kerry is not only one of the least accomplished, most liberal Senators in America, he would have reduced our offensive capability to spitballs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zel Miller is not a Democrat in any sense of the word. But more importantly, his speech was a steaming pile of B.S. Kerry&#8217;s plans for the military and homeland security will make us BETTER equipped for today&#8217;s dangers, not less. That isn&#8217;t partisan spin &#8212; it&#8217;s according to the people who are doing the work: the military and intelligence communities. As for &#8220;most liberal,&#8221; have you actually READ the National Journal&#8217;s report &#8212; the one the Bush campaign cites when they say Kerry is the &#8220;most liberal&#8221;? If you did, you&#8217;d see that they specifically say the Bush campaign is flat-out wrong.</p>
<p>As with most of your statements here, there isn&#8217;t a shred of credibility to them.</p>

<p>Until Wee Willie Winkle gets his wondrous wanderer&#8217;s windup time machine gee-by-golly developed so that wonks with wide, watery eyes can use it to further study, wistfully, want-to-be-but-won&#8217;t, what-they-wish-were-true-but-aren&#8217;t 9/10 dream worlds, I wish to brutally interject, honey buns, that we&#8217;ve been at war with terrorism, according to the terrorists, since the 1972 Munich Olympics. Of course we, the United States, weren&#8217;t really involved in Munich&#8211;just Israel that time, we had to wait a few years for the outright murder of American citizens. But, my lovey doves, they made up for their neglect of us: in Beirut, on the Mediteranean Sea, in Saudi Arabia, in Africa, in Aden and&#8211;whoops! what happened, sweethearts? (as Bogart might&#8217;ve said)&#8211;in New York City on September eleventh, in The Year of Our Lord, 2001. On that day, 9/11/04, whether you blithering, liberal idiots remember it or not, we lost more people than we lost at Pearl Harbor on 9 December 1941. I was sixteen when I listened to the news of the Japanese attack on the radio, in the kitchen of a ten-dollar-a-month behind-the-mill walkup apartment, and I was seventy-six when I watched the planes flying into the Trade Center towers on television, and I fully remember both of them, just as I remember the news that North Korea had invaded South Korea, the news that well nigh one million Vietnamese escaped from the north after the communists took over in Hanoi, the news, and pics that recorded &#8220;Hanoi Jane Fonda&#8221; playing like she was shooting down American planes, the news that &#8220;four month wonder&#8221; Kerry declared all American soldiers who served in the Nam (some two and a half million) were murderers, rapists and worse, the news that after we backed out of South Vietnam, giving the North Vietnam Army a clear shot, the North Vietnamese rounded up a million or so people and slammed them into &#8220;reeducation&#8221; camps and a million or so of the southern Vietnamese forsook the mainland and took to pirate infested waters to escape the communist tyranny. Yeah, honey dolls, I remember all this, and I remember Iserved as an infantry GI in Europe, as an infantry platoon medic in Korea, and as a Medical Group operations sergeant in the Nam. I remember all this stuff cause I played a part, a damned small part, I acknowledge, in WWII, Korea and Vietnam. So whine and bitch all you want, pretty boys, when Bush or Cheney mentions 9/11, memories of the crashes, the flames, the bodies falling through air, the collapse of the towers, the absolute fear and<br />
panic on the faces of the people fleeing this mass murder site should be enough to remind you that WE didn&#8217;t declare war, the terrorists, all the terrorists did . . . on us.</p>
<p>I hold only contempt for the left-socialist, neo-communist liberals who agree with the &#8220;oil-for-food&#8221; scavengers, the perfidious, &#8220;let&#8217;s not depose Saddam&#8221; France and Germany and their ilk. And if the shoe fits, baby dolls, so be it.</p>

<p>The wedge was there before 9/11.  Each party has their scare tactics.  The Dem&#8217;s have been scaring seniors with Social Security threats (that Republicans would kill it) for decades. (And they never even try to fix it.) Abortion is an issue with both sides.  The Republicans are doing it with terrorists &#8211; oh, except we&#8217;ve lost 3,000 (4,000+ if you count troop deaths).  I live in Chicago and every time I go by Sears Tower, I look around.  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only one.</p>
<p>The reality is these militant Islamists are being arrested all the time in various countries because they want to kill people.</p>
<p>Friedman is entitled to his opinion, but it&#8217;s exacty because we&#8217;re on the offensive that there haven&#8217;t been more attacks here.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a headline a few years ago that was something like this &#8220;Crime Drops And Yet The Prisons Are More Full Than Ever.&#8221;   Duh, it&#8217;s exactly because the prisons are full. The prisons are full of people with recidivistic behavior.</p>
<p>Specifically to the point about the wedge between Amerca and the rest of the World, excuse me, your missing something important.  At least two of our so-called closest friends took big bribes to thwart attempts to enforce the UN resolutions on Iraq.  </p>
<p>Dan, you, Kerry and the Democrats who love to put the blame for the differences totally on us are blind to some of these other issues. A few are: <br />&#8211; the bribes (a very big dynamic), <br />&#8211; EU internal politics (another huge dynamic that goes unreported in the US &#8211; one thing is France and Germany are trying to maintain power as the former Soviet-block countries get stronger),<br />&#8211; the fact that the US is pulling even further ahead of them (our per-capita GDP is $10,000 per year more than most of Europe&#8217;s), <br />&#8211; our employment numbers are so much better (Kerry can complain about Bush, but we&#8217;re in the fives and Europe is in the 9&#8217;s and 10+&#8217;s), <br />&#8211; and last, but not least, there is just plain old fashioned jealosy.<br />I would venture to say that this dislike for the US is mostly about jealosy.  Bush is an easy target for the leftists running many of these countries.  It&#8217;s far easier to blame Bush for their problems than to try to solve them &#8211; so they do.</p>
<p>Democrats don&#8217;t even think about these other issues.  The seething hatred for Bush is blinding them from the above issues.</p>
<p>So, from what I can see, Friedman is confused.</p>

<p>Friedman isn&#8217;t just confused.  He has an agenda, one that will be furthered by the policies of John Kerry, which will make America &#8212; our domestic and  foreign policy, and our economy and defensive posture &#8212; more like Europe.</p>
<p>That, friends, is a sellout of a catastrophic order, all in furtherance of an extreme &#8220;one world&#8221; ideology, the birthchild of socialist propoganda from the last Millennium.  </p>
<p>The scary thing is that folks like Kerry, lacking utterly in moral grounding and pursuing lives of self-indulgence and aggrandizement run rampant, have nothing else to fill their empty, pathetic lives.</p>
<p>Kerry didn&#8217;t just marry up *more* than the other two gentleman on stage last night.  He married up more *twice*.</p>

<p>I see, and approach, a great divide:</p>
<p>Turning first to the right, I smile, wink, and ask &#8220;remember when the Republican Party used to actually try to make government smaller?&#8221;</p>
<p>Turning to the left, I query, &#8220;remember when Democrats spoke out for liberal doses of personal freedom?&#8221;</p>
<p>To the center I say, &#8220;remember when neither party would have supported the HUGE federal government we have today! Most importantly, can anyone remember the last time Bush or Kerry used the words &#8216;individual freedom&#8217; or &#8216;personal liberty&#8217;?&#8221; If so, did you believe them?</p>

<p>&#8220;Most importantly, can anyone remember the last time Bush or Kerry used the words &#8216;individual freedom&#8217; or &#8216;personal liberty&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>At last week&#8217;s debate,  in response to the question about the PATRIOT Act.</p>
<p>Kerry kinda-sorta-indirectly acknowledged that Congress had screwed up in their mad dash to pass it,  and that some of its more obnoxious provisions needed to be &#8220;fixed&#8221;.</p>
<p>Bush,  otoh,  told some of the most outrageous lies I&#8217;ve ever heard,  almost giving credibility to the conspiracy-theorists&#8217; claims that he&#8217;s secretly planning a dictatorship.</p>

<p>Dipstick&#8217;s bogosities aside,  there actually are some issues that,  mirabile visu,  actually have something to do with &#8220;technology&#8221;  ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>&#8220;the Patriot missile system doesn&#8217;t work&#8221;</p>
<p>Well,  it didn&#8217;t work as an ABM system,  but it was originally designed as an anti-aircraft defense.  It probably would be useful to protect important sites from kamikaze-style attacks.  In fact,  I think I&#8217;ve read that it&#8217;s doing just that in D.C.  (Personally,  I&#8217;d rather see them deployed around targets like nuke and chemical plants near population centers:  Congresscritters are cheaper and easier to replace  ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>Do a goooogle* search for the B-1B&#8217;s exploits in Afghanistan:  it&#8217;s an interesting tale of redemption.  The Air Force took what was,  indeed,  something of a white elephant,  and modified it to  handle conventional bombing missions.  Among other things,  they used it as a substitute for heavy artillery.</p>
<p>This is important to dealing with terrorists because,  contrary to the Bushies&#8217; constant bellowing about being &#8220;at war&#8221;,  most of the military action _will_ be more like police work.  The targets won&#8217;t be on battlefields,  trying to hold on to territory:  they&#8217;ll often be among innocent civilians,  more likely to retreat than to try and stand their ground.  As with crime investigations,  most leads wo<br />
n&#8217;t pan out,  and the course of events when they do is not easy to predict.  But a key difference is that the nature of the people they&#8217;re looking for makes it far more likely that they&#8217;ll have to be killed,  rather than captured.</p>
<p>Under those circumstances,  cruise missiles don&#8217;t work,  because they have a long delay between the time you fire them and the time they hit.  And it&#8217;s very likely that the people doing the hunting won&#8217;t want to be clomping around with a howitzer or helicopter gunship in tow:  it&#8217;s bad PR,  and tends to take away the element of surprise.</p>
<p>So,  as strange as it would seem to someone who grew up on images of B-17s or B-52s,  a high-altitude bomber can be the most effective and precise tool,  with the lowest risk to innocent bystanders,  in many of the situations terrorist-hunters are going to encounter.</p>
<p>Is it the cheapest method?  Sometimes yes,  sometimes no.  But I don&#8217;t really care,  because the biggest cost isn&#8217;t measured in dollars,  and the are plenty of examples of what happens when the people trying to nail the bad guys are indifferent to the fate of innocent bystanders.</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t have to worry about the government going too crazy with this tool:  inronically,  the folks Zell Miller decide to support by castigating Kerry for,  among other things,  voting to &#8220;cancel&#8221; the B-1B recently retired most of the fleet&#8230;</p>
<p>* For some bizarre reason Dan&#8217;s content filters are objecting to the the use of the real name.</p>
