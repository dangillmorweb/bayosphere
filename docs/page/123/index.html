				<p>The encryption method used to scramble DVDs to prevent piracy is ridiculously weak. Naturally, it has been cracked. <a href="http://www.2600.com">2600 magazine</a> reported this and posted the cracking software. The DVD industry, which is rich as well as paranoid, has sent its lawyers after everyone who&#8217;s putting up the code, including 2600. </p>
<p>You can argue about whether the act of cracking the enryption scheme was legal or not. You can even argue about whether sites should be liable for posting the code, assuming it&#8217;s actually illegal.</p>
<p>But the industry has gone way over the line. According to a <a href="http://dibona.com/social/dvd/cover/index.shtml">copy of the complaint</a>, posted on a Web site protesting the industry&#8217;s moves, the lawsuit also attacks Web sites that merely put links to the code. This is an attack on the foundation of the World Wide Web, not to mention a broadside against free speech itself.</p>
<p>A court hearing will be held Wednesday morning in Santa Clara County, California. Several Web sites are calling for <a href="http://www.dibona.com/social/dvd/index.shtml">a protest</a>. I don&#8217;t endorse piracy. I do endorse a protest of the DVD industry&#8217;s outrageous tactics.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<li>To better understand the entertainment industry&#8217;s lunacy and arrogance in the DVD-encryption matter, read <a href="http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-9911.html#DVDEncryptionBroken">this solid analysis</a> by cryptography expert Bruce Schneier. Bruce is founder and chief technical officer at <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/">Counterpane Internet Security Inc.</a>
<li>You may also want to let the DVD Copy Control Association know how you feel. That&#8217;s the trade association responsible for this kill-the-messenger lawsuit. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dvdcca.org/contact.html">a link</a> to the association&#8217;s &#8220;Contact Us&#8221; Web page.</p></blockquote>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Hard Disks and Home Audio</font></p>
<p>The blending of information technology and consumer electronics continues, anyway. The latest intriguing move is from a company called Request Multimedia, which <a href="http://www.audiorequest.com/pressrelease4.html">just announced</a> a deal with Quantum Corp. to create &#8220;the first component designed to store, organize and play up to 300 hours of CD-quality digital music.&#8221;</p>

<p>My colleague, Mike Langberg, got this piggy bank in the mail yesterday from Microsoft. It was part of a package that included Microsoft&#8217;s new tax-preparation software. As far as I can tell, it isn&#8217;t really made of silver, though. Not even Microsoft is that crass in the way it deals with journalists.</p>
<p>The accompanying software CD-ROM is interesting. It&#8217;s another copy of the tax software, and Microsoft invites the buyer to give it away to a friend. Looks like Intuit and its TurboTax product, which have a massive market share, are in you-know-who&#8217;s sights.</p>
<p>Given Intuit&#8217;s share &#8212; close to monopoly status by any measure &#8212; it&#8217;s good to see some competition here. If Microsoft manages to capture another market by giving away the product, however, it would bring to mind another little business tactic that got certain folks in trouble in federal court recently.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not quite shades of Netscape, though. As far as I know, Microsoft hasn&#8217;t declared tax-preparation software to be an integral part of the operating system&#8230;</p>
<p>(Note: In the original version of this posting I mis-identified Intuit&#8217;s tax product &#8212; thanks to the alert reader who corrected me.)</p>

				<p>The Internet stock bubble has been obvious for some time. But <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2413814,00.html?chkpt=zdnntop">this story about LinuxOne&#8217;s IPO</a> from the Wall Street Journal (via ZDNet) may be the ultimate cautionary tale for anyone willing to view the phenomenon realistically.</p>
<p>Are investors really this foolish?</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>A Highlight I Didn&#8217;t Forget</font></p>
<p>One of my personal highlights of the year was starting this online column, and one of the coolest parts of the process has been the ability to update the site from a Web browser. This is part of an ongoing transformation, in which we&#8217;re learning to create content on the Web, for the Web.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t make the <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg122199.htm">annual highlights list</a>  that ran in my newspaper column, however. Dave Winer wondered why. He&#8217;s man behind the company that created <a href="http://manila.userland.com">Manila</a>, the software we&#8217;re using to publish eJournal. It&#8217;s a fair question.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been posting from Web browsers onto the Web &#8212; and from old-fashioned Internet-connected terminals onto the Net&#8211; in other ways before now, such as Newsgroups and Web-based discussion groups. Tech companies have been turning server software into applications we run from our browser clients, meanwhile. </p>
<p>Some of the potential coalesced this year. Dave and his team took the process to a higher level, adding much more sophistication and possibilities for those of us doing the posting. I&#8217;m grateful for this enhanced ability, and have said so in my column several times this year. I expect to keep saying so in this space, as the product&#8217;s capabilities grow.</p>
<p>It was a very close call as to whether to put Manila and other software of this kind on my highlights list. I didn&#8217;t for two reasons. I didn&#8217;t want to seem self-indulgent, talking yet again about the online column in the newspaper. I&#8217;m also fairly sure that 2000, not 1999, will be the breakthrough year for such technology. I expect to see a bunch of new tools that will take this kind of content creation to a much higher level &#8212; tools that use the sophistication of the client more than Manila is able to do today. The Userland Software folks, along with Microsoft and other smart companies, are working on this right now. I can barely wait to see what they come up with.</p>

<p><font size=4>My List of Not so Great Stuff</font></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been compiling my 1999 &#8220;lowlights&#8221; in the technology world. I&#8217;ll be printing a list on Tuesday in the newspaper. Here are a couple of the items I&#8217;ll be mentioning. As always, if you have suggestions, <span class="email-removed" title="email address removed">let me know</span>.</p>
<p>
<li>Wireless telephone companies innundated the airwaves and pages of various publications with advertisements trumpeting their various service plans. Many of the plans were, compared with what had been offered before, sweet indeed. So lots of customers signed up, and guess what? The wireless companies couldn&#8217;t handle the traffic, and gave their customers a lot of uncompleted and interrupted calls instead of the service that had been promised. I realize this is nothing new in the technology business &#8212; overpromising, under-delivering and then apologizing &#8212; but consumers keep putting up with it, so the industry keeps doing it.</p>
<p>PC companies claimed to be offering &#8220;free PCs&#8221; to consumers &#8212; and of course, were mostly doing nothing of the kind. Typically, you had to buy three years of low-bandwidth Internet service (you were stuck with it even if you wanted faster service later on), and the PC you&#8217;d get was no great shakes. Or, in another trick, companies wanted to know everything about you &#8212; the price was your privacy. Don&#8217;t be fooled by marketing tricks.</p>
<p>The tech industry persuaded Congress to pass a host of unneeded laws, including one of the most outrageous &#8212; an exemption from civil lawsuits for all but the sleaziest behavior related to problems that might or might not be caused by faulty software when the date rolls over from 1999 to 2000.</p>
<p>The industry also put in front of state legislatures &#8212; in battles to be fought in 2000 &#8212; the most anti-consumer legislation in years. It&#8217;s called UCITA, the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, a proposed state law that would utterly destroy the few protections now available to customers of software, Internet services, e-commerce and other products and services. </p>

				<p>A clever holiday greeting card just arrived in my e-mail inbox, from a prominent company in the technology business. Along with the greeting, the message included the following stern warning:</p>

<p>Maybe someone should tell the lawyers to lighten up, at least once a year&#8230;</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Patently Common Sense</font></p>
<p>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is exhibiting uncharacteristic common sense with its decision to <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/business/A26291-1999Dec22.html">review a patent</a> it granted for a Year 2000 bug fix, the Washington Post reports. The patent has been widely ridiculed by critics of the patent system, as it&#8217;s widely believed to cover an &#8220;invention&#8221; that wasn&#8217;t new.</p>
<p>The patent office is a mess, as I&#8217;ve said before. It&#8217;s understaffed, underfunded and overworked. It grants absurd patents all the time, many of which go to software and Internet companies, at an incalculable cost to the economy in the long run. </p>
<p>This review, while welcome, is also shameful. It should never have been necessary in the first place.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Y2K Auction Foolishness</font></p>
<p>It was a clever move of some entrepreneurs to register the <a href="http://www.year2000.com">year2000.com</a> domain name a while back. The owners say the site has been profitable for them.</p>
<p>Now they want to make it even more profitable &#8212; by <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;item=225003545">auctioning the domain name</a> to some sucker &#8212; I mean, entrepreneur &#8212; willing to pay at least $1,000,000. That&#8217;s right, a million bucks. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t doubt that someone will spend this kind of money. These are Internet-bubble times, after all. </p>
<p>But if I had $1 million, I would <i>never</i> use it this way. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p>The reason I and many other people visited this site in the past was to see a roundup of topics related to the Y2K computer glitch. I found the site a bit alarmist, though not as much as some, and mainly used it to follow links to the long list of Y2K-related news articles. I never, ever noticed the advertising &#8212; like many people, I&#8217;ve trained myself not to see Web ads for the most part.</p>
<p>As of early next year, barring a general collapse of life as we know it, I&#8217;m going to stop visiting this site. And so will just about everyone else. Like Cinderella&#8217;s magnificient coach that carried her to the ball, this site seems likely to turn into something of a pumpkin when the new year arrives, or soon after.</p>
<p>Whoever buys the site is going to have to remake it into something worth visiting for all new reasons. A million dollars is a lot of money to spend before you even begin.</p>
<hr width=50%>
<p><font size=4>Ooops&#8230;Porno Guys Love Typos </font></p>
<p>In my posting about the Year2000 Web site earlier today, I left out the final zero in the date when I created a hyperlink to the site. An alert reader who clicked on it let me know where it took him: to a pornography page.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all too typical. Porn sites are infamous for registering domain names that are almost the same as more mainstream sites. So when hapless users mistakenly type in the wrong address, missing one letter or transposing others, they&#8217;re transported to porn pages. Or, when someone like me mistakenly creates a mis-named link, ditto.</p>
<p>I wish the porn folks wouldn&#8217;t do this kind of thing. It doesn&#8217;t make them any friends. And I truly doubt it makes them any money.</p>

				<span class="meta-prep meta-prep-author">Posted on</span> <a href="http://bayosphere.com/1999/12/22/corels-troubles/" title="12:00 pm" rel="bookmark"><span class="entry-date">December 22, 1999</span></a> <span class="meta-sep">by</span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="http://bayosphere.com/author/dan-gillmor/" title="View all posts by Dan Gillmor">Dan Gillmor</a></span>			</div><!-- .entry-meta -->

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>For years, <a href="http://www.corel.com">Corel Corp.</a> has been one of the software industry&#8217;s great mysteries. Some things don&#8217;t change.</p>
<p>In my experience, Corel has been dependably undependable. I recall, back when I was using the OS/2 operating system, how Corel was going to ship OS/2 versions of its software but didn&#8217;t deliver &#8212; something, to be fair, that happened a lot in those days with other companies. Then Corel promised a Java version of the office suite, and didn&#8217;t deliver. The reasons were understandable, but observers learned to take the company&#8217;s comments with a large grain of salt.</p>
<p>Corel&#8217;s flagship graphics products are still among the best, but the company took on a monumental task when it bought the WordPerfect line of products from Novell several years ago.</p>
<p>I use the WordPerfect word processor a fair amount. It&#8217;s a lot like the company, in my experience &#8212; flashy, but somewhat unpredictable, even flaky. At least it doesn&#8217;t regularly crash and eat my work the way Microsoft Word has been doing lately on another computer.</p>
<p>Lately Corel has <a href="http://linux.corel.com/">jumped on the Linux bandwagon</a> in a huge way, writing a Linux version of <a href="http://linux.corel.com/products/linuxproducts_wp8.htm">WordPerfect</a> and, eventually, the entire WordPerfect Office suite. Corel is even selling its own distribution of the operating system. (I&#8217;m planning to try it, and will let you know what I find.) </p>
<p>Given the potential Linux is showing as a desktop operating system, this isn&#8217;t a bad idea, but it&#8217;s yet another long shot. Linux is not a magic bullet for Corel. Why? Because, among other things, Sun Microsystems is giving away <a href="http://www.stardivision.com/">Star Office</a>, a suite that runs on several operating systems including Linux. Yes, Star Office is aimed more at Microsoft and Windows, but Linux competitors could lose in the process.</p>
<p>Investors have been nutty for all things Linux in the past few months. Corel&#8217;s share price has rocketed, partly on speculation that it might be bought by <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat Inc.</a>, the high-flying company selling Linux and services.</p>
<p>A few days ago, however, Corel&#8217;s chief financial officer resigned. Today, the company issued what&#8217;s known as a <a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/reuters/docs/18270l.htm">&#8220;profit warning&#8221;</a> &#8212; saying things weren&#8217;t hunky-dory after all. The stock collapsed, as so often happens after such warnings.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s true, as some say, that hope springs eternal. Corel seems to be counting on it.</p>
