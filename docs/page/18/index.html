<p>The dealer who sold me my Ericsson T-39 mobile phone said there was no USB charger available. I&#8217;d gotten used to carrying a lightweight USB charger with my older Nokia phone, so it was disappointing to go back to carrying a little brick around.</p>
<p>Now, via <a href="http://boingboing.net">Cory</a>, I learn that there <i>is</i> just the item I want, from <a href="http://www.keyspan.com/products/cables/K-ZIP-CELL-ER/">Keyspan</a>. Progress is a wonderful thing.

<p>Didn&#8217;t I read an article about you looking at the SE P-800?  Your analysis is why I decided on a P-800 last year.  But the fact that no US carrier has picked it up has me worried. And it was so late, maybe I should go for a newer model.  Anyway, have you given up on a phone / PDA-lite combo?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still leaning that way. I&#8217;m just waiting for the price to drop slightly, or for the rumored P810 upgrade to arrive&#8230;</p>

<p>Great column by Doc Searls &#8212; <a title="Saving the Net" href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6989">Saving the Net</a> &#8212; in the latest Linux Journal. He asks:<br />
<blockquote><i>&#8220;Who Owns What?</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the fundamental question, and it&#8217;s going to get more fundamental as we roll toward the next presidential election here in the US. Much is at stake, including Linux and its natural habitat: the Net. Both have been extraordinarily good for business. Its perceived &#8216;threat&#8217; to Microsoft and the dot-com crash are both red herrings. Take away Linux and the Net, and both technology and the economy would be a whole lot worse.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Whoa. Cycling with honour has meant very little for decades of the sport and this statement would be greeted with sniggering from anyone who follows it. Cycling has been one of the most scandal and drug-ridden sports in recent years, with much criticism levelled at the sport&#8217;s governing bodies&#8217; willingness to utterly ignore same, especially, unitl recently, in the Tour de France. Few followers &#8212; and I might add, several cyclists I know who nearly went professional &#8212; believe many in the pro peletons are not doping at some point, whether in training or surreptitiously in competition. Note: I am a devoted cyclist and love watching cyclists but I&#8217;ll believe it&#8217;s an honourable sport when every single pro cyclist willingly accepts drug testing on a regular, not random, basis.</p>
<p>If I wanted to give an example of sporting with honour, I&#8217;d suggest the incredibly courageous athletes of the Special Olympics, whom I recently had the humbling experience of watching compete at the World Games in Ireland. There, athletes competed with bravery, dedication, and love of their sport. And have to overcome sometimes utterly astonishing personal challenges against their ever being able to do so. And never whine about contracts, pay, managers, television rights, product endorsements or any of the modern day afflictions of so many of our pampered pro sportspeople.</p>

<p>Karlin, you apparently haven&#8217;t followed the news about cycling during the past several years.</p>
<p>Cycling HAD lots of athletes who were doping. But during the past several years drug testing has been forced upon every pro cyclist in the Tour. The results have been that the dopers were kicked out. Indeed for that reason, many renown professional cyclist are no longer racing in the Tour de France.</p>
<p>All the top placers in every daily stage of this Tour de France are required to undergo drug tests, as are all the top cyclists in the daily standings. Plus, all the cycles who didn&#8217;t place are required to undergo the random test you mention.</p>
<p>So, when Tour leader Lance Armstrong was accidentaly knocked over by a spectator during a race stage earlier this week and the leader of that stage and his main challenger, Jan Ullrich, stopped racing until Armstrong could remount his bike, that&#8217;s cycling with honor and without drugs, which is what Dan&#8217;s posting was about.</p>

<p>I stand by my comments. I live in Europe and follow the Tour de France every year. Indeed, I took great pleasure in watching it here in Ireland within those &#8216;past several years &#8212; when that particular Tour ultimately became  a farcical event in which raids on teams would be followed by a day of cycling and then more raids on teams, the amassing of evidence that the Tour  was riddled with drugs, and charges being brought against several cyclists. </p>
<p>Because the competition times have not altered since the supposed crackdown on drug-taking, I find it very, very hard to believe that this Tour, or the sport as a whole, is much cleaner than it has been in the past. There are many, many ways to test negative, as any doctor familiar with doping problems will tell you. And as many Olympic athletes could also explain. The sport is willing to look in the other direction, and always has been.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know any European cycling enthusiasts who believe this is a clean sport, or that tests as they are currently done mean much. And in respoinding to Dan&#8217;s comments I&#8217;m addressing the larger reputation of the sport, not a single incident within one competition.</p>

<p>I think a big issue that involves information design and useability is that these charts are often dual purpose. They are used in a live presentation and then passed on in hardcopy and electronically as a standalone package. It is hard to get the two uses to coexist effectively. Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

<p>As many of you have noted in e-mails to me, we are having difficulties with the comment-posting feature here. I apologize for this, and our tech folks are working to resolve it.</p>
<p>It looks as though some people are having no trouble, so I won&#8217;t turn off the comments feature entirely. But please understand that you may be one of the unlucky folks who can&#8217;t make it work. One suggestion: Don&#8217;t try using Preview mode for now. </p>
<p>In any event, I&#8217;ll let you know when all is OK, or at least when we <i>think</i> all is OK. Again, sorry for the difficulties.

<p>Ok, I appreciate the Right of free speech. As a pilot, I also respect the rights of a craft&#8217;s captain, which traditionally have been broad. Yes, an airliner may be a common carrier to some extent. But at the end of the day, the command authority of an airline captain is going to rule.</p>
<p>Free speech should be protected. But those who practice it should also work with a bit of common sense. Just as you cannot yell, &#8220;Fire!&#8221; in a crowded theater, carrying a button that says, &#8220;Suspected Terrorist&#8221; on an airplane is certainly in bad taste and worse. </p>
<p>Causing the delay of a flight to make a political statement is, to me, rude. If you effect yourself, fine. But when the captain of an airliner give a passenger an order, generally the passenger has to follow it. That&#8217;s the way it is on any airplane. If I had a passenger interfering with my duties, they&#8217;d be off in a sec. That&#8217;s my perogative.</p>
<p>We need in any free society those people who stretch the outer limits of propriety in exercising the rights many of us take for granted. In their course to expand all our rights, sometimes those people are inconvenienced. </p>
<p>P.S. Be glad that the passengers of this flight don&#8217;t sue John for impinging on their vacations.</p>

<p>Ok, I appreciate the Right of free speech. As a pilot, I also respect the rights of a craft&#8217;s captain, which traditionally have been broad. Yes, an airliner may be a common carrier to some extent. But at the end of the day, the command authority of an airline captain is going to rule.</p>
<p>Free speech should be protected. But those who practice it should also work with a bit of common sense. Just as you cannot yell, &#8220;Fire!&#8221; in a crowded theater, carrying a button that says, &#8220;Suspected Terrorist&#8221; on an airplane is certainly in bad taste and worse. And causing the delay of a flight to make a political statement is, to me, a bit on the rude side.</p>
<p>When the captain of an airliner gives a passenger an order on conduct, generally the passenger has to follow. That&#8217;s the way it is on any airplane. If I had a passenger interfering with my duties, they&#8217;d be off in a second; my perogative.</p>
<p>We need in any free society those people who stretch the outer limits of propriety in exercising the rights many of us take for granted. In their course to expand all our rights, however, sometimes those people are inconvenienced. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a free-speech absolutist, and I have no trouble at all with what British Airways did here.  If Mr. Gilmore wants to have his little joke, he can do it on the ground.  Most of us fly to get from point A to point B, not to make political points.  If making such points is what really matters to Mr. Gilmore, then congratulations to him.  Mission accomplished.  Just don&#8217;t put him on the same plane with me, okay?  Not that there&#8217;s much chance they&#8217;ll let him aboard until he grows up.</p>

<li>NYT: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/18/technology/18MAIL.html?8br">White House E-Mail System Becomes Less User-Friendly</a>. <i>Under a system deployed on the White House Web site for the first time last week, those who want to send a message to President Bush must now navigate as many as nine Web pages and fill out a detailed form that starts by asking whether the message sender supports White House policy or differs with it.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>The obvious purpose of this is to deter letter-writers. That&#8217;s understandable, given the volume the White House receives. But the bureaucratic defense, calling the move an &#8220;effort to be more responsive,&#8221; as someone told the Times&#8217; John Markoff, doesn&#8217;t pass the laugh test.</p>
<p>Another, smaller motive for the redesign may be found in the character of this particular administration. Bush and his people are especially uninterested in hearing from anyone who disagrees with what they&#8217;ve already decided.</p>
<p>I doubt the Clinton people paid any serious attention the e-mail, either. But at least they didn&#8217;t go out of their way to insult the people who bothered to express their views.</p>
<p>Advice: Don&#8217;t bother complaining to the White House about this. No one is listening.

<p>Please. It&#8217;s just challenge/response technology, combined with extra data appended to the email so that the White House can more easily sort the email automatically. That&#8217;s all they&#8217;re doing. Please don&#8217;t read conspiracy into everything. Regardless of political beliefs, keep in mind that it&#8217;s good to be more efficient sometimes, and that&#8217;s obviously what&#8217;s happening here. Along with the need to probably reduce spam&#8230;</p>

<p>If it were simply a way to sort the mail, it wouldn&#8217;t ask whether or not you support the policy.  </p>

<p>>If it were simply a way to sort the mail, it wouldn&#8217;t ask whether or not you support the policy.</p>
<p>Do you think politicians avidly scan their mail for policy ideas?  The only thing Bush or any other politician cares about is whether or not voters approve of his policies.</p>
<p>If the gauntlet of web pages reduces the number of emails the White House gets, that is a good thing.  Why should my tax money pay for several dozen drones to filter out spam, drunken ramblings, and messages typed in all caps?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since anyone insulted my intelligence as badly as the third sentence of the quoted article:</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past, to tell President Bush </p>

<p>After reading the story in the Washington Post about the Republican Attorney Generals&#8217; questionable fund raising. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3050-2003Jul16.html?nav=hptop_tb">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3050-2003Jul16.html?nav=hptop_tb</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not hard to imagine that Microsoft bought the contract with the DHS, not to mention the DOJ antitrust settlement.</p>

<p>This must be manna from heaven for Al Queda. Microsoft servers powering the Dept. of Homeland Security have security breaches large enough to drive an aircraft carrier through. </p>
<p>Or, possibly this is a sting operation. That&#8217;s right. The DHS is actually laying a trap to find Al Queda hackers. Once found, a Preditor drone will drop a Maverick missile on them. </p>
<p>It couldn&#8217;t be that the DHS is foolish enough to have the world&#8217;s least secure operating system running DHS servers because they think MS makes the best server product? Could it?</p>
<p>I wonder what type of quid-pro-quo deal is going on here.</p>
